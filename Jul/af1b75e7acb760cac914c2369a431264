What makes a statue a good one? Well, one would think an accurate resemblance plays a key part. Except in many cases, things have gone horribly wrong. The Slovenian hometown of the US first lady revealed a life-sized statue of its first lady on the outskirts of Sevnice to mixed reviews after a sculpture was carved from a tree. The sculpture is supposed to emulate Flotus during her husband's 2017 inauguration. It's not the only statue that has gone wrong. From Ronaldo to David Beckham and actor Johnny Depp, a few artists have missed the mark.
