A man's car was hijacked while he waited outside his girlfriend's house  in Albertville, Johannesburg.  He was later  forced to withdraw a large amount of money, police said on Thursday. "He stopped in front of the gate at his girlfriend's house and he waited for her to open the gate. A vehicle stopped behind him and three guys with firearms jumped out," police spokesperson Captain Jerbes de Bruyn said. The incident happened just after 7pm on Tuesday. De Bruyn said the suspects forced the man  into the back of his  car and drove off with him. They took him to an ATM, where he was forced to withdraw cash. The amount  given was R19,000. De BruynÂ said the man was later dropped off close to the FNB Stadium in Soweto, where he managed to phone for help. He was  unharmed.
