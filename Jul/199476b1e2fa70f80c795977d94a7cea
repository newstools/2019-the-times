Nigeria ousted holders and bitter rivals Cameroon from the Africa Cup of Nations as they scored twice in three minutes to come from behind and win a thrilling last-16 match 3-2 on Saturday. Odion Ighalo gave Nigeria a 19th-minute lead but Cameroon hit back with two goals in quick succession before halftime from Stephane Bahoken and Clinton Njie to take a 2-1 lead. Ighalo levelled again for Nigeria in the 63rd minute amid suspicions of offside before Alex Iwobi snatched the winner for the jubilant Super Eagles three minutes later. The win earned Nigeria a quarter-final against hosts Egypt or South Africa who were meeting later on Saturday.
