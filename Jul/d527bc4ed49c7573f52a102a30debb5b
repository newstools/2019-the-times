Six young paddlers ran into trouble off the Durban coast after strong winds blew their kayaks out to sea on Friday. A National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) team who were conducting a routine training session were dispatched to assist the six youngsters. NSRI Durban station commander Andre Fletcher said the six paddlers, on three double kayaks, ran into trouble off-shore near Vetchâ€™s Beach. "The sea rescue craft caught up with them. Towlines were set up to tow them to shore. "The six, aged between 18 and 19, were reunited with their families."
