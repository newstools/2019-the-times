Kindu is a sensual choose-your-own-adventure app for couples. After both of you join up and "connect", you can swipe through more than 100 naughty suggestions that you may be into trying. If you and your partner think you're both into an idea, you'll "match up" and launch the activity card in Tinder-like fashion. This will then become a list you can work your way through together. Each activity card allows you to track your progress, mark it off as complete and see the percentage of users who also liked the idea. The app ranges from romantic to raunchy depending on your preference, but overall it is an easy and judgment-free way to see where your desires align as a couple. In every relationship one partner is always a little more competitive than they should be. In this game, you wield that, uhm, drive, for the greater benefit of all. Then again, in a good sex game, everyone lands up being a winner. This "game" app pits you against each other in a series of sexual dares. There are thousands to choose from: categories ranging from "risk of being watched" to "love sensations", and new ones are uploaded weekly. Each partner sends the other a series of dares to consensually accept. If they go through with the dare the sender receives points. Get enough points and you'll "unlock" new challenges and take your sex life to new levels.
