The cold temperatures in Johannesburg are affecting more than just moods. It is causing a strain on the city's power network. "Under these conditions the electrical system is prone to unplanned outages resulting from overloading and [an] increase in consumption demand," City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said in a statement on Wednesday. "City Power has however put plans in place to tackle such unplanned outages," he said. Mangena said the core of the plan was attending to areas that had unplanned power outages on the same day or week. This included: "The plan has also driven City Power technicians to repair and replace those parts of [the] network that have contributed to repeated power outages," Mangena said. "However, these efforts are not only dependent on City Power alone to stave off power outages. According to the weather forecast, the temperatures will stay low for the rest of the week. As such we urge our communities to save electricity."
