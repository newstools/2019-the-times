Fresh from their victory over the Wallabies at Ellis Park last weekend, the Springboks are facing the All Blacks on Saturday morning in Wellington. The last time the Bokke played at the Westpac Stadium, in 2018, they defied the odds to beat New Zealand 36-34, and will be hoping for another win to bolster their and the country’s hopes for victory going into the World Cup, when they will meet the All Blacks in the group stages. With this year’s abridged Rugby Championship line-up - the four top southern hemisphere teams only facing one another once instead of twice, in only three rounds - fans can’t afford to miss a game. Even if you’re not at home, there’s no excuse to miss any of the action. Showmax has recently added selected live sports events to its slate of content, and will be streaming the match live at 9.25am on Saturday July 27.
