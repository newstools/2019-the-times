Five senior coloured and white Western Cape detectives are at the centre of a WhatsApp race battle after sending slurs and photographs of gorillas and monkeys, with two of their colleagues’ names attached. The detectives – who are all stationed at the Khayelitsha police station – were charged with crimen injuria and defamation of character on Monday.
