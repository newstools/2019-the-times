The state capture inquiry will continue to hear the Estina farm-related testimony of  former farmer Willie Basson,  former director of National Treasury Dumisani Cele and  agricultural economist  David Andreas Maree. The Estina  project,  signed off in 2012, was promoted as a tool by the provincial government to benefit small-scale Free State farmers, using their services to produce and sell milk on a large scale. However, of the R220m transferred out of state coffers to Estina, a Gupta-linked company contracted by the Free State's agricultural department to run the project, only 1% was spent on  farming. Most of the remaining money went to individuals and entities associated with the Guptas. Then Free State premier Ace Magashule, who is now the ANC's secretary-general, and former Free State agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane are among  the alleged key facilitators of the deal.
