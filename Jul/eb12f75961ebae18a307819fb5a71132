An Eastern Cape traffic official was disarmed at a fuel station shop in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth. Denel van der Merwe, 29, and her fiancé were standing in a queue waiting to pay  when the officer was disarmed and subsequently fled from the man brandishing her weapon. SAPS spokesperson Capt Andre Beetge said  the robbery on Monday led to a car chase that resulted in a shootout, but no arrest. "The suspect fled in a white BMW, but the officer’s fiancé pursued him and a shootout ensued, resulting in the man sustaining a gunshot wound to his leg through the left passenger door of his vehicle," he said. "The culprit was then able to escape and no arrests have been made.​" Beetge said  the suspect was  armed prior to disarming the officer. The officer's fiancé is recovering after  medical treatment.
