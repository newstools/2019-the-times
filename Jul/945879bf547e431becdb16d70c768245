"A brutal story, brilliantly written, carried by wisdom and love." – Marianne Thamm "I am in complete awe. I had no idea what the Lowe family went through in those final months. Get Me to 21 is deeply moving and inspiring." – Pippa Hudson, Cape Talk ABOUT THE BOOK Get Me to 21: The Jenna Lowe Story is the riveting memoir by Gabi Lowe, the mother of Lead SA activist Jenna Lowe, the brilliant teenager who was the driving force behind the famous #GetMeto21 campaign. Jenna was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension, an extremely rare illness that, after a double lung transplant, ultimately led to her untimely death, four months before her 21st birthday.

Despite the tragic loss of Jenna, Get Me to 21 will leave the reader deeply inspired and reminded of the capacity and depth of the human spirit. Embracing grit, resilience and never turning her back on the hope of saving her daughter's life, Gabi Lowe encourages us to believe that the ability to face darkness lives deep within us all.
