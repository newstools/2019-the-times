Drug smugglers are coming up with more and more creative ways to move their wares. CNN, The Guardian and Fox News report that a Colombian man  was nabbed at Barcelona airport in Spain at the end of June allegedly attempting to  smuggle half a kilogram of cocaine under his wig. Two things gave him away, according to police - his nervous demeanour and the  height of the wig. CNN further reports that  Spanish police  arrested about 12 members of the same "drug-smuggling" syndicate in May. They reportedly smuggle cocaine-infused plastic products, which are later taken to  specialised laboratories for the drug to be extracted. A month ago, a 74-year old woman was allegedly caught with heroin  at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport. Sars spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi told TimesLIVE that the woman was destined for a central European country.
