Transport minister Fikile Mbalula has joined the chorus of congratulations for Robert Marawa on the launch of the sports personality's online sports channel, promising  advertising from the department. Marawa took to social media on Thursday to announce the launch of  Marawa.tv, which will air on YouTube. The announcement came just more than  a month after he  was fired from his popular Thursday Night Live with Marawa show on SuperSport. Mbalula took to Twitter on Friday to congratulate Marawa and offer him  support. “Do your thing, Robert. You have what it takes. (The) transport dept will advertise there," he wrote. Mbalula's comment drew mixed reactions, with some applauding him for supporting Marawa and others claiming he  had no say over where advertising went. Mbalula defended himself, saying he saw nothing wrong with his tweet. Marawa thanked the minister for his support and said the pair would help "transport sport to a better place safely". Mbalula and Marawa clashed on Twitter  in February, when the transport minister  accused the sportscaster  of supporting the EFF, after he posted a short video from the Soweto soccer derby showing a helicopter flying the party's flag. Marawa found the stunt entertaining, but Mbalula did not, and what followed was an exchange in which EFF leader Julius Malema also got involved. In 2017, things got so heated between the two that even recording artist Oskido intervened, effectively forcing them to shake hands and put their differences behind them. Most recently, the pair seemed to bury the hatchet in a social media video of them bantering.
