Musician Johnny Clegg has been laid to rest in a private ceremony attended by family and close friends. His longtime manager, Roddy Quin, confirmed that Clegg's funeral took place in Johannesburg on Wednesday. He said it was "what Johnny wanted". Quin confirmed that  memorial services were being planned and details would be revealed once he had discussed plans  with Clegg's family. "I can confirm that Johnny Clegg was buried by his family at a small gathering of people, which was his familyâ€™s request and his request. We will be making an announcement perhaps at the end of the week about a memorial service, which everybody, the public will be invited to," Quin told SABC. Clegg died on Tuesday after a five-year battle with pancreatic cancer. Tributes have been pouring in for the musician, who was hailed for his contribution to music and uniting South Africans across colour lines.
