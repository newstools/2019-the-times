A photoshopped video of Trevor Noah impersonating Whitney Houston's hit track, I Wanna Dance With Somebody is the funniest thing you will see all weekend. Trevor shared the video which has been doing the rounds on social media to his own Instagram page. "Haters will say it's fake," he captioned it. It is not clear if Trevor made the video himself. But it will definitely make you LOL.
