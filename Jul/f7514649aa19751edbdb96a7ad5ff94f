Zodwa Wabantu set tongues wagging when she arrived at the Vodacom Durban July on Saturday in a sheer, crystal-encrusted dress that left little to the imagination. Zodwa, who recently had a non-surgical breast lift - was accompanied by her aesthetic doctor Mahendra Premchand, who performed the procedure on her. "My breasts were sagging. I went the non-surgical route because I didn’t want to go under the knife." Zodwa - renowned for her barely-there outfits and reality show Zodwa Uncensored, told TshisaLIVE that her dress was adorned with over 4,000 crystals. "Look they are not Swarovski, but I wanted to shine... so here I am." Her doctor explained that he used a revolutionary new method, which involved using threads to lift the lax breasts. "I’m natural. I don’t wear make-up, so I don’t take hours with make-up and hair that is usually required for events like these," said Zodwa. Despite her risque outfit, Zodwa found herself being side-stepped when the flamboyant Somizi and his entourage made an appearance at the famous tent town. Also spotted among the early-comers was Khanyi Mbau, resplendent in a white ensemble.
