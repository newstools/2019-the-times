After what the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) called a “long journey” of 20 years, former spy boss Richard Mdluli was on Tuesday found guilty of kidnapping his customary wife, Tshidi Buthelezi, and her new husband, Oupa Ramogibe. He was found guilty on four counts of intimidation, three of assault and two of kidnapping.
