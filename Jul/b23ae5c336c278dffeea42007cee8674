Former president Jacob Zuma's first state capture testimony dominated news headlines yesterday, thrusting it to the top of Twitter's trends lists. Zuma, who has been central to allegations of state capture, addressed the Zondo commission of inquiry on Monday and is set to testify until Friday. Appearing before deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo for the first time, he is expected to name those he accuses of using the commission to discredit him.
