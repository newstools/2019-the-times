The funeral will take place at The Crossing Church‚ 107 Macgillivray Road‚ Glenferness AH‚ Midrand on Thursday‚ starting at noon. A big‚ physical and combative centre-forward‚ Batchelor’s soccer career spanned the 1990s and early 2000s‚ also playing for Dynamos‚ Bidvest Wits‚ SuperSport United‚ Mamelodi Sundowns and Moroka Swallows. He was gunned down in a hail of bullets on Monday evening last week in the driveway of his home in Olivedale‚ Johannesburg‚ by two men riding a motorbike. Batchelor’s gardener‚ who was with him at the time‚ escaped unscathed. His dog‚ Dakota‚ was seriously injured in the shooting. A high-level police task team are reportedly investigating that the cause of the murder was related to drug dealing.
