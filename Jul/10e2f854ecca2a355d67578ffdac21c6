A high-level police team is investigating the link, as well as Batchelorâ€™s relationship with Serbian national Ivan Djordjevic, who was shot dead in a similar manner in his Bryanston home in April. The two men were in business together and it is believed their murders could be in revenge for the theft of the cocaine. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
