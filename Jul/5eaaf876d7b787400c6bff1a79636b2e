A 13-year-old boy has died after he fell from a train in Soweto, Johannesburg. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics responded to the scene near the Merafe train station after 2pm on Sunday. The boy sustained a head injury and was found at the bottom of an embankment, next to a stream. Herbst said rescue workers set up a rope and basket system to retrieve his body. The train tracks in both directions were shut down.
