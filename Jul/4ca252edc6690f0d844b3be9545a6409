Two men have been arrested on a farm near Stutterheim, Eastern Cape, after they were caught allegedly stealing more than 80 sheep. Capt Siphokazi Mawisa said police received a tip-off from a community member after he saw the sheep out of the camp on the farm in Kubusiedrift. Mawisa said police reacted swiftly and caught the  men, aged 34 and 53, in the act. A fence was cut near the road, releasing 88 sheep. The animals  were recovered and handed back to their  owner. Mawisa said police  also recovered knives, pliers and a rope from the  men. They are expected to appear in the Stutterheim Magistrate's Court on Thursday on charges of stock theft.
