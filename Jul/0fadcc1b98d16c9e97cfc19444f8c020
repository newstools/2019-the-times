Johannesburg residents have been urged to exercise extra caution after a baboon  was spotted  in Northcliff, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. The baboon was first seen  in Krugersdorp three weeks ago, according to Hassan Kassin of Community Led Animal Welfare (Claw). "It was first seen at Krugersdorp, then Florida, and now Northcliff. It has moved around a lot, we're on the ground to try to capture it," he said. Footage from  a drone captured the creature moving at speed along walls, across balconies and down a  road in Northcliff. Kassin warned residents against getting close to the baboon as it was likely to become aggressive around people. "It is not used to being in a space where there are a lot of people, so we advise that people do not get close to it. They must remain indoors and call us immediately," he told TimesLIVE. Owners of domestic pets were urged to keep them indoors. Kassin expressed concern at the lack of suitable food for the baboon. "It's been surviving on food from the dustbins, which is not suitable. It can be affected by food poisoning, for example, and die ... but we're determined that we'll be able to capture it," he said. This will not be an easy task. Kassin said it would be trapped by placing a cage containing food close to its location. Claw and SCP Security urged anyone who knew the baboon's whereabouts to immediately contact 082 926 3627.
