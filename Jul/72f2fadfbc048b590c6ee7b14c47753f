If everyone read a book a day for 73 years, we would have read 26,645 books in our lifetime. Of course, it’s not exactly possible, but reading regularly is the only way we learn and grow. We may live in a digital age, but many will still recall the early days of computing when the pundits said that books would become obsolete. However, what these prophets should have considered is that the first book printed with movable type, the Gutenberg Bible, was published in 1455 and books are still being published today. This longevity will never be matched by computer programmes that change constantly, are “improved” and then abandoned. Books are magical and add something to our lives, a characteristic that is embodied in fantasy writer George R.R. Martin’s famous quote: It is right then that we pause and take a moment or two to celebrate the marvellous fiction and facts contained within books. While we pause, we can also wonder at the world records that printed words and books have created. They include: All fascinating, but the reality is that globally an estimated one in five adults are still illiterate. The highest incidences of illiteracy are found in South and West Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Illiteracy is a problem that shouldn’t exist and is one of the reasons why MiWay Insurance has dedicated itself to encouraging literacy in SA.
