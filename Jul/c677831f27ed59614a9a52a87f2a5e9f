The JSE closed lower on Thursday as a rally by the rand failed to lift banking stocks.The rand dipped below R14 to the dollar in intra-day trade — its best level since mid-April — as expectations mount that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, amid concern of a slowdown in global economic growth. Jitters about the decline in growth were further fueled by poor manufacturing data from the US, the eurozone and China this week. By the JSE’s close, the rand had gained 0.16% to R14.0329/$, 0.12% to R15.8333/€, and 0.1% to R17.6548/£. The euro was flat at $1,1283. The rand earlier reached a best level of R13.9566/$.After its good recent run, the gold price was down 0.24% to $1,415.01/oz. However, FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said in a note that the challenging global economic conditions are likely to favour gold as it is considered a safe-haven asset. “The investment case for gold is set to remain robust as speculation mounts that major central banks will ease monetary policy in an effort to counter a global economic downturn. “Gold shone with extreme intensity during the second quarter of 2019, rallying roughly 9% to levels not seen in more than six years, above $1435/oz. This was thanks to an environment that included ongoing global growth concerns, [problematic] geopolitics, trade tension and dollar weakness.” Platinum was last seen down 0.69% to $833.46/oz. Brent crude was down 0.59% to $63.54 a barrel.
