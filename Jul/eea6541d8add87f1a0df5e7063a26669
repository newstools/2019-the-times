"We will not tolerate behaviour that places the lives of innocent women and children and other commuters at risk. This extends to the conduct of those who operate services and those who may be taking part in protest or labour action." Mbalula assigned the new transport department director-general, Alec Moemi, to develop a national safety and security policy for public transport. "This exercise must lead to direct in-sourcing of at least 80% of security personnel by Prasa. These security officers must receive their basic training from SAPS, and I have discussed this with Minister Cele."
