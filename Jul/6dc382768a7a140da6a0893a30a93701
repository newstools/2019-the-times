South Africans continue to pay tribute to Mandla Maseko, after he died in a bike accident on Saturday,  with many commenting  that he had inspired them by beating the odds. Maseko,  popularly known as "Spaceboy", beat more than a million people to win a sub-orbital trip that would have seen him become the first black African in space through the Axe Apollo Space Academy. Since the announcement of his death by a family spokesperson at  the weekend, social media has been filled with tributes for Maseko.
