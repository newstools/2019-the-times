There was a tense stand-off in parliament on Thursday when EFF  MPs  approached the podium in an attempt to prevent public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan from delivering his department's budget speech. Gordhan, however, was not moved, daring them to  "try touch me". The  MPs were then ejected from parliament and Gordhan delivered his speech.
