Zimbabwe's government on Tuesday offered its workers 180 million Zimbabwe dollars ($21 million) additional pay for the July to December period, which unions rejected as inadequate in the face of soaring inflation, a public sector union official said. The amount, to be shared by 309,000 civil servants, would see each worker receiving only an additional $11.28 a month, Thomas Muzondo, the deputy chairman of public sector union Apex Council told Reuters after a meeting with government negotiators.
