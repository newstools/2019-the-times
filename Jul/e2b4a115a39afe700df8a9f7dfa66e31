The Hawks rescued 19 Ethiopian men who were being held captive in a home in Johannesburg. However, they said they were still investigating whether it was a case of human trafficking or kidnapping. Spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mulamu said they were tipped off and raided the house around 3pm on Friday afternoon. “The men have been rescued … There are no visible injuries.” The Hawks arrested one suspect, who will appear in the Booysens Magistrate’s Court on Monday. They also recovered a pistol and police radio in the house.
