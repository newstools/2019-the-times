Limpopo police on Tuesday arrested a mother for allegedly chaining her disabled daughter to a chair in a locked room. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Bela-Bela community members tipped off the police at about 9am “about a child who was not treated well by her own mother who often locked her alone inside their house”. When the police arrived, they found the disabled girl, 12, chained to a chair in a locked room. The mother, 30, will appear in the Bela-Bela magistrate’s court on Thursday.
