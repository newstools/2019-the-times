For a person who's academic achievements don't go as far as high school, Zodwa Wabantu is not shy to admit that the kind of money she has is the envy of many "educated" people but she's shared that she doesn't look down on education and wants her son to have the best options. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Zodwa posted a video of herself kneeling down asking her son not to underestimate the value of education based on her lifestyle or anything else. In the video, Zodwa can be heard advising her young boy to stay in school and get an education because life is hard. "Ngicela ufunde mnta'nam," she said. Zodwa previously told TshisaLIVE that she often gets praised for having the "kind of money" she has without qualifications. She said even though she has worked hard and continues to do so, she is aware that it was just God that made things work out the way they did. That is why, Zodwa explained, she would never diss education and wanted her son to get as much of it from the very best institutions as he can. "Other people call it luck, others say its God... I know that I could have been one of the broke, unemployed people in this country but luckily I'm not. I've managed to build a house and buy my car and take my child to school, which is amazing for me." "I always emphasised to my son that he must not worry about what people say about me and the sh*t I do, he must just focus on school. I want him to be successful and even if he ends up not needing to use school, he must have education as back up."
