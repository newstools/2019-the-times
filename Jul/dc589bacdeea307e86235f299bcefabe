Lalla Hirayama's mom was left emotional after the TV personality surprised her with a new car. Taking to Instagram, Lalla also penned a heartfelt note to her mom. "I'd buy you the world if I could....I don't know many who have gone through as much as my mom... one day I hope she shares her story with the world... she's my hero, my 'why', the reason I won't quit. "If she can go through all she has, I've got the strength to do it all. I'll forever be your protector, your guardian, your daughter. I'd buy you the world if I could, but for now this will have to do... I love you mama." Sweet!
