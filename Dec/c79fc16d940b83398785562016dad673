A man was gunned down in an apparent hit in Mitchells Plain on Thursday afternoon. People at the scene said a white vehicle drove past and they heard gunshots. The victim was hit in the face and body, reported Netwerk24. Police spokesperson Brig Novela Potelwa told TimesLIVE that the victim – whom police have not yet identified – was a 32-year-old male. She said a teenager, aged 16, was also wounded. The incident happened at about 3:30pm on the corner of Silversands Street and De Duin Avenue in Westridge. “The 16-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance,” said Potelwa. “They were standing on a corner when a vehicle with occupants drove towards them and shots were fired. “Crime scene experts are combing the scene for clues. Additional resources from Mitchells Plain and the Anti-Gang Unit have been deployed in the area,” she added. Netwerk24 said the shooting may have stemmed from a fallout between the Hard Livings and the 28s gang.
