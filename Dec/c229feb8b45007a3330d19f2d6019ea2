We are barely at the halfway point of the season and already there have been 27 coaches who have manned the dugout at the 16 Premier Soccer League clubs. One more will certainly be added when Baroka FC announce their replacement for Wedson Nyirenda, with former Black Leopards coach Dylan Kerr the likely appointment, in the next week. Six of the 16 teams have made changes to their technical team so far, but astonishingly five of those have already had three separate men in the hot-seat as the coaching merry-go-round is in full swing. To be fair, Vasili Manousakis was always going to be a caretaker appointment in between the tenures of Benni McCarthy and Jan Olde Riekerink at Cape Town City. But for the rest it has been a case of genuine chopping and changing. In Black Leopards’ case it has been enforced as, following the axing of Frenchman Lionel Soccoia, they appointed Luy Eymael, only for the Belgian to quit this past week. They have filled the gap with Cavin Johnson, who will take charge of his first game with Lidoda Duvha travel to Highlands Park on Sunday. Johnson started the season at AmaZulu, before he was replaced by former Polokwane City coach Jozef Vukusic. Polokwane themselves had Zlatko Krmpotić at the start of the season and he took them to the top of the table very early before a downturn in form saw him axed. He was replaced for yet another spell by Bernard Molekwa, but after four straight defeats the Limpopo side have now opted for Clinton Larsen to arrest their record run of 10 losses in a row. Larsen had begun the campaign at Chippa United, but was axed five games in and Duran Francis handed the reins in the hope he could steer the ship. But after three games he was replaced by Zimbabwean Wedson Nyirenda, who had vastly improved the side and lifted them off the foot of the table. But there is no doubt the most high-profile changes have been at Orlando Pirates, after Serbian Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic walked out on the club after only three games of the season to take up a post with Zamalek, from which he has already been sacked. Rulani Mokwena was given the task but managed only four wins in 15 games – and one of those against Highlands Park was assisted by the match officials – before he was replaced by the German Josef Zinnbauer. It was a big moment for South African football, with many feeling 32-year-old prodigy Mokwena would be a breath of fresh air through the local game. But it was perhaps a post that came too soon for him and he would be better served building up his CV elsewhere before taking on such a high-pressure role. Luckily he has a lot of time on his side.
