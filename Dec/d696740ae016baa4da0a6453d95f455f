As Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi begins her new life in New York, her schedule has been filled with interviews from around the globe. Zozi posted an image of her strutting her stuff. In a separate post on Instagram, she highlighted how the crown is sitting "beautifully on my kinky coarse hair." There are no details on when Zozi will return to SA for her official homecoming, but the beauty queen has promised to give updates as soon as she has them.
