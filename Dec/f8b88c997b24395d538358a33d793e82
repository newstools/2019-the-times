A 10-year-old child lost her life in Tafelsig during "a random shooting between rival gangs" on Sunday night, said Western Cape police. Two suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing. Police said on Monday that officers from Mitchell’s Plain and the Anti Gang Unit, who had been alerted to shots being fired, apprehended the suspects in a street-by-street raid. A 21-year-old with an unlicensed firearm was arrested not far from the scene while a 26-year-old was arrested in Olifantshoek Street in Tafelsig. "Both suspects are believed to have strong links with local gangs," said police. There is a heavy police presence in the area comprising Mitchell’s Plain police, Operation Lockdown forces as well as Anti Gang Unit members in an effort to create safety and prevent flare-ups, the SAPS said. "The deployments will remain in the area until calm is restored."
