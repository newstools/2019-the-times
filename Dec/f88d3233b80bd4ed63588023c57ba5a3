A 45-year-old man from Mondeor, south of Johannesburg, has been arrested for perjury. Brig Mathapelo Peters said he was nabbed on Saturday. He had told police that he was followed from a Standard Bank branch on Thursday after he had withdrawn cash. He claimed that while opening the gate at his home, three male suspects who had been in a white Toyota Fortuner following him, held him up with a firearm and took him into the house, where they robbed him. “An investigation revealed that he opened a false case,” said Peters. The suspect will appear in the Johannesburg magistrate's court on Monday.
