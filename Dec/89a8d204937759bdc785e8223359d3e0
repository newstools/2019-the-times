They allegedly shot the driver and sped off in his vehicle,” said Gwala. Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson said: “On arrival, paramedics found a man who had sustained a gunshot wound to his upper body. “He was in a critical condition and was stabilised on scene by advanced life-support paramedics, before he was taken to hospital.” Cases of hijacking and attempted murder were opened. No arrests have been made. In Pietermaritzburg, two men were arrested for allegedly holding up staff at a business with a toy gun. Police said employees at the firm in Moses Mabhida Road were opening for trading  when they were approached by the men. “At gunpoint, the suspects demanded the shop keys and locked the doors, with employees inside, as they demanded cash. Witnesses alerted police, who  forced the door open to gain entry.” The men, aged 27 and 38, were found hiding in the roof cavity. “They were found in possession of a toy gun and cash stolen during the robbery. A case of business robbery is being investigated,” police said. The men are expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg magistrate's court on January 2.
