The Blitzboks are in the final of a World Sevens Series event for the second week in a row after they beat France 21-12 on Sunday. After last week’s win in Dubai they again surged into the final when they accounted for a plucky French side. Again‚ however‚ they were afflicted by a slow start. They made too many unforced errors which allowed France a foothold in the game. In fact‚ it was France who shot into the lead when Marvin O’Connor crashed over to score a converted try. Ruan Nel‚ however‚ again made some telling contributions with his gainline busting exploits. He helped level matters when he touched down before JC Pretorius sold the French defence a rather cheap dummy next to a ruck and ran clear to score under the posts. The result was sealed when Siviwe Soyizwapi rid himself of a French defender with 90 seconds left on the clock. France hit back in the dying seconds with a try but by then the result was beyond doubt. The Blitzboks earlier beat Kenya 17-5 to reach the semis‚ while France got into the semis after a 19-10 win over Argentina. Fiji beat Ireland 31-12‚ while New Zealand beat Scotland 35-19 to set up their semi-final. In the women’s draw there were semifinal wins for New Zealand over Canada and Australia over France.
