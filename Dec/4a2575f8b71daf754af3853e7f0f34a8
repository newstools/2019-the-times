Eskom says load-shedding is not anticipated on Tuesday - though it is appealing to people to use electricity sparingly. The system remains “constrained and vulnerable” on Christmas Eve, the power utility said in a statement. However, its staff are working throughout the holiday period to ensure the stability of the grid. Due to reduced demand as a result of the festive season and the return of some generating units to service, Eskom said it has not had to use emergency diesel supplies to supplement capacity since Sunday.
