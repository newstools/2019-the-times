Eskom announced on Thursday that it would implement stage 2 load-shedding from 4pm to 11pm. The power utility said in a statement that unplanned breakdowns had left the system “severely constrained” and apologised for having to cut power. “Eskom would like to inform South Africans and all its customers that the electricity system is severely constrained. “In the power alert issued earlier this morning Eskom informed that unplanned breakdowns were at 12,300MW, and that there was a probability of load-shedding at short notice if unexpected shifts, such as additional unplanned breakdowns, were experienced. “We have experienced a loss of additional generation. As a result, it has become necessary to implement stage 2 rotational load-shedding ... to protect the power system from a total collapse,” read the statement. “We unreservedly apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them and want to assure the nation that we continue to work tirelessly to ensure security of energy supply.” After a winter without power cuts, Eskom resumed load-shedding in October when multiple unplanned outages and other issues took more than 20% of generation capacity out of the system, TimesLIVE reported in November.
