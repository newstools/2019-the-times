A bus carrying passengers caught fire on the N1 north near William Nicol Drive on Wednesday morning. Johannesburg metro police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the bus was travelling from Cape Town to Zimbabwe. Pictures of passengers escaping through the windows have been widely circulated on social media. “There have been no injuries reported. It is only the luggage burning, but there is a fear of an explosion,” Minnaar said. He said emergency services were on the scene battling the blaze. Traffic in the area was heavily backed up and motorists were advised to use alternative routes. Shawn Herbst of the Netcare 911 paramedic service said they were alerted just before 7am. “Reports from the scene indicate that a bus had caught alight, setting fire to the trailer. Fortunately the passengers and crew managed to escape just as the entire bus became engulfed in flames.” Describing the scene, he said, “The area around the bus was littered with baggage as passengers scrambled to retrieve whatever belongings they could.” The cause of the fire is under investigation.
