Why were cornflakes invented? This was the question most asked by South Africans of  search engine Google this year. According to statistics from Google's 2019 Year in Search lists, the history behind the cereal topped the list of trending questions. Although Google released the lists to provide "a unique insight into the year's major moments", just why the invention of cornflakes was the country's most burning question was baffling. Other top 10 questions included how to draw eyebrows. Unsurprisingly, load-shedding, Bosasa, Baby Shark and Zodwa Wabantu were among the trending items on the search lists. "This year's trending searches show South Africans’ keen interest in the world and people around them. Pop culture, sports and politics captured the nation’s attention. Nine of the 10 top trending search terms were for local people, news and events. The top questions list reflects this strongly, with eight of the top 10 questions related to local happenings. "From the Rugby World Cup to load-shedding, elections and James Small, South Africans use search to find out about the things that really matter to them," the search engine said in a statement. It said search trends information was gleaned from data collated by Google, based on what South Africans have been searching for and asking Google during the year. "Google processes more than 40,000 search queries every second. This translates to more than a billion searches a day, and 1.2-trillion searches a year worldwide," the search engine said.
