The probability of load-shedding for the rest of the week remains high, with stage 2 rotational power cuts continuing on Monday, Eskom said. The embattled power utility said load-shedding was expected to stop at 11pm on Monday. However, additional units had been lost on Sunday night. It said unplanned breakdowns were above 12,000MW, about a quarter of the utility's nominal generating capacity. “As a result we have been unable to conserve water and diesel as required to stop or to minimise load-shedding for the coming week.” Eskom said load-shedding was required to enable it to replenish water reserves for its pumped storage schemes. “We continue to ask customers to reduce demand as a concerted collective effort can help to avoid or lessen the level of load-shedding.”
