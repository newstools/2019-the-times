Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has been admitted to hospital in Cape Town. In a short statement, Tutu's wife Leah said he had been admitted "for a stubborn infection". Details of when he was admitted were not provided. "The Archbishop has been hospitalised several times over the past few years for treatment of a similar condition," she said. Tutu last month celebrated the Springboks' Rugby World Cup victory in Cape Town.
