Do you remember Indecent Proposal — that '90s movie in which a stranger offers a married couple a whopping $1m to spend a night with the wife? Well, as part of the 2019 Sunday Times Lifestyle Sex Survey, we put a similar proposition to our readers. We asked, “If a stranger approached you to have sex for a huge amount of money, how much money would you accept?” Here's what some of the over 4,000 South Africans who took this year's survey had to say: • “I wouldn't do it for any amount of money” — Female • “I would do it for free if she's hot” — Male • “Probably, I'd start at R10k if he was hot. Higher, if not” — Female • “Depends massively on the stranger, but around R50k.” — Male • “I wouldn't have sex with a stranger. To me, sex is not just sex. It's about showing your love for and sharing a deep connection with your partner.” — Female • “None. I don’t sell my body.” — Male • “Millions, I'm that good ..." — Female • “Enough money to cover all my debts.” — Male • “No amount would be enough. I'm financially secure and don't think I'd be willing to risk my mental health due to the shame I would feel.” — Female • “Depends on the stranger, but R1m minimum.” — Male • “I would only do it on condition that we use condoms. Maybe R40k.” — Female • “It depends on the amount of money. If it's like six figures, then yes. I won't pretend that I wouldn't, I need the money.” — Female • “Anything above R5k will do.” — Male • “Yes I would, it's just sex no big deal.” — Female • “I would accept anything from R2k upwards.” — Male • “R500k at least.” — Female • “First I'd have to discuss it with my wife.” — Male • “R5k upwards.” — Female • “Depends who they are, anything from R10k to R100k.” — Male • “My body is not for sale.” — Female • “It would be ruining my relationship. If I was single probably R20k.” — Male • “Anything above R30k.” — Female • “I will not have sex for 1) money 2) with a stranger.” — Male The 2019 Sunday Times Lifestyle Sex Survey was run in conjunction with Ratepop.
