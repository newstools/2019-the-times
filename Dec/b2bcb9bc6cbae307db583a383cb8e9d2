Eskom on Monday night downgraded load-shedding from unprecedented stage 6 back to stage 4. Eskom said on Twitter: “Eskom unreservedly apologises to South Africans for stage 6 load-shedding as we revert back to stage 4 from 10pm on Monday to 11pm on Tuesday.” Earlier, due to a number of factors, including wet coal, stage 6 was implemented for the first time in the country's history.
