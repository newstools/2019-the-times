Nonceba Molwele has been elected unopposed as the new speaker of the City of Johannesburg. The DA boycotted Wednesday's council meeting which was set to elect a replacement for former speaker Vasco da Gama. The party maintains that Da Gama, a DA councillor was not legally removed from his position as speaker at a meeting last week. The dispute is about whether the ANC managed to get the correct majority to remove DaÂ  Gama. DA Gama took over as speaker in 2016 when a DA coalition took over the metro with the support of the EFF. Molwele was a former health MMC under then mayor Parks Tau. Despite both the DA and the EFF boycotting Wednesday's meeting, the city council managed to reach a quorum and pass the vote. Wednesday's outcome means the ANC-led alliance government, which includes Cope, the IFP, Patriotic Alliance and AL-Jama, is able to run council and pass budgets without trouble.
