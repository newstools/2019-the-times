The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation  said on Friday that Archbishop Desmond Tutu was continuing to receive treatment in a Cape Town hospital. In a statement, Niclas Kjellstrom-Matseke, the foundation's chairperson, said the Tutu family hoped that the archbishop would be discharged early next week. Kjellstrom-Matseke said the family was grateful for all the love and prayers sent since Tutu was admitted for a “stubborn infection”.
