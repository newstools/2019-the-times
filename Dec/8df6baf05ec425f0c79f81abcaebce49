The ANC is back in control of Johannesburg, with Geoff Makhubo taking the reigns as the cityâ€™s new mayor on Wednesday. Makhubo won 137 of 268 votes. Previous mayor Herman Mashaba stepped down on November 27, blaming tensions within the DA. Mashaba had filled the position as a result of a coalition between the DA and EFF. The coalition has since deteriorated, allowing the ANC to reclaim control of the city.
