Heavy K has hit back at those who have weighed in on his personal life and mocked his weight, saying his size has never stopped him shutting up his haters. The star has been heating up dance floors this December, but found himself the topic of conversation after news of his split from his wife, Ntombi Nguse, broke and people started making nasty comments about his size. When one user said many SA women relentlessly body shame men and rapper Cassper Nyovest agreed, Heavy jumped on Twitter to respond. The Inde hitmaker told Cassper: “They do it all the time but me I don’t give a sh*t, bro. I’m living my best life and my weight never stopped me from finishing them.” Heavy K also responded to a user who said his marriage had failed because he never deserved “that pretty wife”. Nguse confirmed their split in a statement on Instagram at the weekend. “We fell deeply in love with each other and we always will have love and respect for each other, as we share a special bond together through our children. However, once a relationship becomes something toxic and starts taking away from the person that you are, then it's time to let it go. “I didn't like the person I was becoming in that relationship, neither did I like who my partner had become. We both wronged each other in ways that can never be repaired,” she wrote.
