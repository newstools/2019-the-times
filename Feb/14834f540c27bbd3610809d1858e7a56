The DA's preferred candidate, Stevens Mokgalapa, has been elected the new mayor of Tshwane. Mokgalapa takes up the position after former mayor, Solly Msimanga's resignation took effect on Monday. Msimanga resigned from the post after almost two-and-a-half years in office to focus on his campaign as the DA's Gauteng premier candidate. Mokgalapa, who hails from Tshwane, was a councillor in the metro for nine years, and was most recently an MP and  the party's spokesperson on international affairs. Mokgalapa's election on Tuesday was uncontested as no other party nominated a candidate. Tshwane is governed by a coalition-led government in which the DA does not have enough votes without either the ANC or the EFF's support to pass  decisions. Therefore, the lack of other candidates worked in the DA's favour Mokgalapa said in his inaugural address that he would be a mayor of action, and would thus focus on stabilising and refocusing the administration, speeding up service delivery, creating an environment that enabled job creation, keeping the city’s residents safe and rooting  out corruption. In terms of corruption, Mokgalapa said if the council failed to execute its legal mandate to hold senior managers accountable, he would approach the courts to do so. He said he would improve consequence management in the city  and ensure recommendations of forensic investigations and reports of the auditor-general were implemented. Mokgalapa also said that he would ensure there was an independent forensic investigation unit in the city that could investigate any allegations of wrongdoing or corruption. He said he would  announce his mayoral committee soon. - BusinessLIVE
