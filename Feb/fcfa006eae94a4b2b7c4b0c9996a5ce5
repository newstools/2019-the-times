US designer Daniel "Dapper Dan" Day claims the CEO of Gucci is set to fly from Italy to Harlem, New York this week to meet with him and other black designers over the company's release of a sweater that has been labelled racist and likened to blackface. The iconic brand was forced to issue an apology last week after it released a black wool balaclava, which has a slit near the mouth framed in red. The design shocked fans who flooded social media timelines with messages accusing the label of mimicking the racist practice of light-skinned people painting their face to appear black. While celebrities around the world have called for a boycott of the brand, Dan said he wanted to meet with its leadership to discuss the situation. Dan, who works for and collaborated with Gucci told his followers on Instagram that he was outraged. "I am a black man before I am a brand. Another fashion house has gotten it outrageously wrong. There is no excuse nor apology that can erase this kind of insult." "The CEO of Gucci has agreed to come from Italy to Harlem this week to meet with me, along with members of the community and other industry leaders. There cannot be inclusivity without accountability." Meanwhile local comedian Loyiso Gola has weighed in on the boycotts, telling fans he was so poor, joining the boycott would be useless.
