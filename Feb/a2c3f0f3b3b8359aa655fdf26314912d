The police officers who stopped a woman walking down the road because of her bulky stomach must be brave indeed. Johannesburg metro police department chief David Tembe revealed on Wednesday that officers attached to the crime prevention unit had nabbed a female suspect for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and live ammunition. With a straight face, the police arrest record states: "The officers noticed the suspect walking along Valda Street in Rosettenville with something in her waist band and an unlicensed firearm was recovered." Other successes by the city's cops in the past couple of days include the seizure of drugs valued at R120,000 in Windsor, during which three suspects were arrested. Officers also arrested a suspect after a man was robbed of his watch and ring on Bram Fischer Drive, Randburg, on Tuesday evening. JMPD operations officers in Booysens arrested five people the day before for possession of suspected stolen copper cables.
