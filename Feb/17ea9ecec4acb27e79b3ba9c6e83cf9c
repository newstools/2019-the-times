As news broke of the arrest of Bosasa executives, including Angelo Agrizzi, on Wednesday, many on social media questioned why Gavin Watson was not arrested.Â The Hawks arrested seven people in connection with the alleged illegal awarding of tenders worth millions of rands by the department of correctional services. Agrizzi, Andries Van Tonder and Patrick Gillingham appeared in the Pretoria Special Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday on charges of fraud, money laundering and corruption. Carlos Bonafacio and Frans Voster appeared in the same court on separate charges relating to Bosasa's dealings with correctional services. Former national correctional services commissioner Linda Mti, who lives in Port Elizabeth and another suspect, who the Hawks refused to name, did not appear in court. Watson and other Bosasa officials were only implicated in the allegations made at the Zondo inquiry into state capture. This week's arrests form part of a nine-year investigation by the Hawks. The crime-fighting body has warned that more arrests will follow. "The arrests follow a marathon investigation, where almost R1.6bn is said to have been misappropriated in the tender processes for the procurement of various services by the Department of Correctional Services. The tenders were awarded to Bosasa operations and its subsidiary companies," said Hawks spokesperson Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi The suspects appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court.
