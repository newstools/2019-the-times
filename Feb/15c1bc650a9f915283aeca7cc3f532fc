From raising the “dead” to wig-snatching, here are the top five videos for February. “Resurrection miracle” Alleluia Ministries pastor Alph Lukau raised eyebrows after a video from his Sunday service showed him “wake” a “dead” man.  The video, which was uploaded on Lukau’s YouTube page, quickly went viral on news and social media platforms. Budget speech Finance minister Tito Mboweni delivered the budget speech in Parliament on February 20.  He detailed National  Treasury’s plans for  education, power utility Eskom and job creation. Teacher praises student Wayne Tewson, a teacher at  Bracken High School in Alberton, trended for praising a student in a rather unique way. The teacher can be heard shouting: “What is this?”, to which the student responds:  “It’s my work sir.” He then tells the pupil to go to the front so her classmates can clap for her. Trevor Noah at the Oscars US-based South African comedian Trevor Noah had  Oscar attendees  fooled on Sunday night when he shared an isiXhosa  joke only South Africans would understand. Presenting an award for  Black Panther, he said:  “Abelungu abayazi uba ndiyaxoka,” which means “white people don’t know that I’m lying”. However, he translated it as “in times like these we’re stronger when we fight together than when we fight apart”. Wig-snatching While most people hold their phones and wallets close when walking the streets or hide them in their car boots while driving, there is another item that now needs to be kept out of sight and, possibly, insured – the wig. This video shows just how easily this woman’s hair piece is snatched off her head.
