Police have confirmed that two people have been arrested after two people were killed in a shooting at the Edenvale High School in Johannesburg on Thursday. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela told TimesLIVE on the scene that two people had been arrested. Makhubela also said that an unknown number of men had fled the scene in two cars. Police are still searching for them. An AK47 was visible, close to the school gate. Makhubela said that a total of three unlicensed firearms had been recovered by police. The arrests come after an apparent midday robbery attempt at the school. Two suspects were shot dead and a third was injured, according to paramedics on the scene. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was at the school from around 2pm. Pupils were also still on the premises. Ekurhuleni emergency medical services spokesperson William Ntladi, who was at the school, said earlier that they had received information of multiple gunshots at around 12pm on Thursday afternoon. "As per information received it was an armed robbery that the guys were going to do here at the school. "Fortunately the children were inside their classes and no one was outside. It was just an emotional traumatic experience for them,” Ntladi said. Ntladi said on arrival they found two men that were shot dead by police. A third was in a stable condition after he was shot in the head. He was being treated on the scene by paramedics. Police have barricaded the road with yellow police tape, and forensics experts have also arrived at the scene.
