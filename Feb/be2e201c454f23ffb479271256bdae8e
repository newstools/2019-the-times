It was panic stations at Bosasa's headquarters in Krugersdorp on Friday after staff were told a liquidator would be taking over. Managers were seen standing outside the yard of the controversial company's plush offices in Luipaardsvlei. Bosasa,Â now known as African Global Operations, was placed into voluntary liquidation on Monday after a damning series of allegations of its involvement in state capture were made at the Zondo commission of inquiry. Workers confirmed that they had earlier on Friday been called to a meeting with the liquidator. Obakeng Moagi, from the Financial Sector and Allied Union of South Africa (Fawusa), said operations at the company would continue as normal until the end of March. "The liquidator has assured us that workers will receive their salaries for the end of March and right now, workers have also received their salaries for this month today," said Moagi. He said the union was working with the liquidator to see how jobs could be saved. An employee who only introduced himself as Tshepo said it was tense at the company as employees' jobs were not guaranteed. "It's really bad. We don't know what will happen after this," he told TimesLIVE.
