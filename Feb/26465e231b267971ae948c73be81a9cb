The man appointed as liquidator of controversial state contractor Bosasa said on Friday he was unsure whether workers would be paid until the end of March, as claimed by a union representative. Cloete Murray, who took over as liquidator a week ago, was speaking outside the company's headquarters in Luipaardsvlei, Krugersdorp, where the SA Revenue Service was busy collecting information. Murray said Sars had contacted him immediately after he took over as liquidator. "They are just here to collect electronic data and they are busy with that now," Murray said. Employees have downed tools and were leaving the company premises on Friday afternoon following a meeting with the liquidator earlier in the morning. They had arrived at work in the morning to find the gates locked. "We didn't know what was happening and private security people barred us from entering," one employee told TimesLIVE. He said they were only allowed to enter the premises after 10am when the liquidator had arrived. Murray said the board had been dissolved and he was taking over the running of the company. Union representative Obakeng Moagi said the liquidator had assured them that workers would be paid at the end of March. However, Murray could not confirm how long operations would continue at the company. "I just arrived and can't really answer that right now," he said. On Monday, the embattled company - now renamed African Global Operations - announced that it was voluntarily applying for liquidation after banks had notified them that they would cut ties with it. Sars acting chief enforcement officer, Viwe Mlenzana, said they were busy with various enforcement issues across the country. Mlenzana said they were also investigating issues raised at the Zondo commission and other commissions. However, he said thatÂ Section 69 of the Tax Administration Act prohibited them from naming taxpayers they were busy dealing with.
