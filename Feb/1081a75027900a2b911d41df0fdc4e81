Controversial media owner Iqbal Survé has been using the bank account of one of his companies, which received billions of rands of government pension money, as his personal piggy bank. Ayo Technology, in which Survé is a shareholder through African Equity Empowerment Investments (AEEI), formerly Sekunjalo Investment Holdings, has been courting controversy since the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) announced it would invest R4.3bn in it to create the largest black-owned ICT company in December 2017. The PIC paid R4.3bn for a 29% stake at R43 a share, when the company's real value at the time was said to be hovering around 15c a share.
