Gauteng police are looking for information that could lead to the arrest of those involved in the murder of a missing Edenvale woman. The 42-year-old woman - who has not been named - was reported missing on Monday. On Tuesday, her body wasÂ found buried in a shallow grave in a veld near the R511 in Pretoria West. "Through collaboration by police from Limpopo and Gautengwoman with Tracker, police were able to confirm that a partially-burnt Mercedes-Benz found by Limpopo police ... belonged to the Edenvale woman" said police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters. Peters said Sergeant Henning of the Pretoria K9 unit had employed the services of a search-and-rescue dog named Tyson, who had reacted positively to a spot in the veld. After some digging, the police had found a travel suitcase. Further sniffing by Tyson had led to another suitcase, in which her body was found. "A postmortem will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death. A motive is yet to be determined, while police are at this stage appealing for information from the public towards establishing the circumstances surrounding the woman's death, and towards the apprehension of the perpetrator or perpetrators of this crime," added Peters.
