Disappointment trended on Twitter as Proteas player Duanne Olivier announced his move to quit international cricket to join England's Yorkshire County Cricket Club.Olivier signed a three-year deal with the county, rejecting a two-year contract offer from Cricket South Africa. The fast bowler played 10 Tests‚ taking 48 wickets at 19.25‚ and two one-day internationals — both against Pakistan last month. "My decision might be difficult for some to understand but  being a professional cricket player has a short-lived career and in order for me to make the most of all my opportunities, I had to consider all my options," he said in an Instagram post.Cricket South Africa was not too pleased with the his decision and released a statement on his exit that did not hide this at all. "We find it extremely disappointing that Duanne has taken this step after all the opportunities we have given him, particularly over the past season and going forward, to live his dream of being an international player," said chief executive Thabang Moroe.There was a mixed response from fans on Twitter with some accusing him of "turning his back on SA" while others said they understood the move.
