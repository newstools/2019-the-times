Eskom will be in the spotlight as the state capture inquiry resumes on Wednesday. The Zondo commission's legal team, led by advocate Vincent Maleka SC, will put Eskom-related documents on record. On Tuesday,Â National Treasury economist Catherine MacLeod said then-president Jacob Zuma's axing of Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister in 2015 had both long- and short-term effects on SA's economy. MacLeod said political uncertainty had "real costs" and that Nene's removal had a "long-lasting" impact. Zuma dropped the axe on Nene during a surprise cabinet reshuffle in December 2015, appointing the little-known ANC backbencher and suspected Gupta family ally Des van Rooyen as his replacement. The move sent the rand into a nosedive and Zuma replaced Van Rooyen four days later.
