Zodwa Wabantu won't pretend to be cool with you to ease your conscience and her forgiveness ain't for free. Zodwa has also been accused of wearing less clothing by the day and has received more insults across different social media platforms. She made it clear that she doesn't care much for such comments and it's not her fault they have a problem with her. "I see everything, it's just that other things I am just not interested in. Like I can't pretend. The thing is if you do wrong by me, I see no use of forgiving you or continuing to bother myself with you. If you have done me wrong, that's how it will stay. I won't pretend otherwise," she said. She said Lerato Kganyago told her forgiveness has great benefits for the one who forgives but she ain't feeling none of that so she's skipping that philosophy. When asked why she did a u-turn from her plans to retire this year, Zodwa also made it known that she couldn't have predicted that the demand would still be this high. "It's not my fault money likes me and it's not my fault that people still want me to come dance for them. There's more coming from me as long as the calls keep coming." Listen to Zodwa vent below.
