A woman has been arrested following the dramatic rescue of a baby found in a stormwater drain in Durban last week. Police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the woman was arrested on Monday. "A 27-year-old suspect has been arrested ... while at a local hospital. She was arrested for attempted murder relating to a child found in Newlands East last week," said Mbele in a short statement. She later confirmed that the arrest was in connection with the discovery of a baby found in a stormwater drain. The baby's dramatic three-hour rescue captured international media attention. Mbele said the arrested woman was under police guard and would appear in court soon.
