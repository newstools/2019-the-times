The Mpumalanga education department said it was disturbed after robbers vandalised Tsakane Special School in Acornhoek over the weekend and stole equipment meant for disabled pupils. “The perpetrator took almost every resource meant to teach learners with severe intellectual disability, as well as admin equipment,” said department spokesperson Jasper Zwane, adding that the security guard on duty was assaulted. A criminal case has been opened. “Police are working around the clock to apprehend the culprits and are calling on anyone with information to contact them," said Zwane. “The department is really concerned about this incident and has pledged to work with the law enforcement authorities to bring to book those that are behind this.” The school was opened four years ago and caters for 200 learners with severe intellectual disabilities. The department said the incident not only set them back but deprived learners of their constitutional right to education and further robbed them of a brighter future.
