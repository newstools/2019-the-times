Rapper Blaklez has once again got Mzansi music fans in their feels after releasing a track this week about depression and attempting suicide. The track, called I Have No One, starts with an apology for everything from "having a dark face" to secretly wanting to commit suicide. "I'm sorry that I have been an underdog my whole life. I'm sorry that I'm secretly trying to take my own life. I'm sorry that when I am by myself I drink the whole night. I'm sorry that I don't believe I'll be alright." He went on to explain how music helped overcome dark thoughts. "Life tried to kill me with depression. To protect myself I used music as a weapon. It gets so dark that I can barely see the blessings. When life teaches me, I can hardly see the lessons." Although the star did not specifically say the song is about him, he does touch on several unique experiences and included voice notes from friends, that had fans thinking it was about his own life and struggles with mental illness. The track went viral on social media and led to the artist taking to Twitter to speak about the inspiration behind the song. He explained that the song had "triggered" many fans and he wanted to address his followers. "The song is about people, generally, who are suffering or dealing with mental health issues, and attack the stigmas attached to it." He said that there needed to be a change in thinking, where instead of people with mental illness having to adapt to society, society adapts to them. "Environments and society should adapt to people living with mental health issues,"he added.
