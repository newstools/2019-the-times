Former ANC member and leader of the newly formed African Transformation Movement party Mzwanele Manyi got a taste of the fierceness that is Democratic Alliance MP Phumzile van Damme. Manyi took to Twitter to commend Van Damme for speaking up against Helen Zille's call for a tax revolt. And then sommer invited her to join his party. Van Damme was obvs not in the mood. Ouch! Van Damme started Monday off by taking shots at Zille for her tax revolt idea. Van Damme chastised Zille for not talking about the idea with her party before she decided to announce it on social media.
