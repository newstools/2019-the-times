From opposition party manifestos, a special tribunal and more Eskom woes, here are five big stories from the weekend you may have missed.Ramaphosa's special tribunal The president has established a special tribunal to assist the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to fast-track the process of recovering money and assets that have been lost through corruption in state institutions. Ramaphosa has appointed judge Gidfonia Mlindelwa Makhanya to head up the tribunal for a period of three years. Zizi Kodwa: rape allegations The ANC's acting spokesperson Zizi Kodwa on Sunday denied "with contempt" rape claims by a woman who was allegedly raped at a private function. DA manifestoThe main opposition party held its election manifesto on Saturday in Johannesburg. Its manifesto included proposals such as awarding vouchers to people earning between R4,000 and R15,000 to buy or build their own homes or to use the voucher to finance bonded properties. Eskom The SIU is investigating 11 contractors for reportedly stealing R139bn during the construction of the Medupi, Kusile and Ingula power plants. Sunday Times reported that insiders say the total cost of looting at Eskom could reach about R500bn, dating back to 2005. Dan Matjila Former head of the Public Investment Corporation Dan Matjila has been named as a key player in a dodgy R1.8bn loan by the PIC to a consortium looking to buy a stake in the oil giant Total.The deal is to be investigated by the inquiry into the PIC headed up by former president of the Supreme Court of Appeal Lex Mpati. *Editor's note: Rape accused are not allowed to be named until they plead in court. In this case, we are naming Kodwa because he has given permission to be named and issued a public statement.
