President Cyril Ramaphosa is more popular than the ANC, a survey by the party has found. A poll conducted by the governing party’s research unit says Ramaphosa has an approval rating of 73% by South African voters, whereas only 60% of those polled are pleased with the ANC. The ANC has set itself a target of at least 60% of the national vote in the May 8 polls, which would be an improvement from the 54% national support it received in the 2016 local government elections. The party received 62% in the 2014 general elections. But Ramaphosa’s support may not automatically translate into ANC votes — as was the case with former president Nelson Mandela, who was also more popular than the party but could not get it beyond 63% of the vote. “The people have got to see the president in the image of the ANC," said ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula. "The two are not disconnected." “When he acts in government and does good things, people see Ramaphosa, not the ANC, but that is so because of where we come from with an ANC that was associated with badness because of the head of state.” Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
