While most of Mzansi was stanning over Bonang's saucy lingerie pictures on Monday, one follower felt the credit was not deserved. Just hours before B spoke at the UN Women Summit in Mumbai, she shut things down by sharing a string of steamy snaps of herself. If you have no clue what we're talking about, don't sweat, we've got you covered. While B's snaps nearly shut down the internet, one tweep believed that her booty was overrated. Bonang quickly set the hater straight with a stern and stinging clapback.
