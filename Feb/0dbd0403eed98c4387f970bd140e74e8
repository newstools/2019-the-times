If you think you know Ekurhuleni - think again - because its geographical features are about to undergo a major name change. The Ekurhuleni council adopted renaming of geographical features last Thursday and the proposed changes will affect major roads, the theatre and the library. City of Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe said the process to rename landmark features in the Gauteng city would bring honour and pride to the residents. Gadebe said the name changes were just proposals at this stage and he could not say how much the proposed changes would cost. "Once the process has been concluded, costs will be determined," he said. The council has adopted 42 recommended names. "It's still a proposal report. It will still go back to council to be adopted after consultations," Gadebe said. The city said: "These names will go through a consultation process through an advertisement in the local media for comments and objections, while public hearings and constituency meetings organised and facilitated by councillors will also be held." According to Gadebe, the consultation process will be through "an advertisement in the local media for comments and objections, while public hearings and constituency meetings organised and facilitated by councillors will also be held".
