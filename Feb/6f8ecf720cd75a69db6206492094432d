Nandi Madida decided to drop some pearls of wisdom to warn upcoming artists about the danger of being robbed. "We live in a world that’s so money obsessed, it’s important not to forget that relationships are paramount too, in fact something that is worth more than money is maintaining relationships&having a good reputation. Money comes and goes.. it’s important that your character is rich," she said. In a lengthy thread Nandi reflected on how she was nearly robbed and advised other artists to be wary. "Now I know why artists die poor even though they have millions due to them.. it’s so sad. Myself and my friend almost became a victim in one case."
