Gauteng police on Wednesday urged the motorist who was filmed being attacked and robbed while sitting in slow-moving traffic in Randburg to come forward. The incident was captured on video by another motorist who was in the same traffic jam. "The case was not opened at the Randburg police station, which is the closest station to where the incident took place," said Capt Mavela Masondo. "Perhaps they opened the case at another police station and it is yet to be transferred to the Randburg police station ... but we are appealing for them to come forward,"  Masondo added. A person who was in another vehicle, just a few metres away, captured the incident on her phone and later shared it on social media. The footage quickly went went viral on Wednesday. It showed two men dressed in dark colours leaning into a Renault Kwid, seemingly violently grabbing at the driver. While vehicles around the car are hooting, no one jumps out to help the victim. At one point, one of the robbers has his entire upper body inside the vehicle. "Why aren't people getting out to help?" one woman can be heard saying in the footage. The driver of a small truck, who was in front of the Kwid, opens his door but one of the robbers gestures something to him, leading to him retreating back into his vehicle. A taxi is standing in the lane next to the Kwid. One of its passengers leans out of the vehicle as he observes the entire incident. The woman who took the video later tweeted that they tried to assist once the attackers had gone away. "We were only able to help him once those guys left, we offered to call anyone for him or drop him off so he could get his spare keys ... He got beat up badly though. The car assistance people came and helped him too, I hope he’s okay now," she wrote. Masondo said police officers would be deployed to the area to ensure the safety of motorists.
