The winner of the country's biggest-ever PowerBall - a staggering R232m - says he was "very excited" when he realised the cash was his. Speaking to eNCA, the man - who was only willing to divulge that he was a 50-year-old Capetonian - said his greatest joy was that the money would enable him to provide for his children's education. "I am very excited, and Iâ€™m glad I won this," he said. "For me it will open doors for my kids' education because that is very important to me. I'm very happy, and I'm glad," he said in a clip posted on the news channel's Twitter feed. The man came forward and claimed his prize on Monday, and travelled to Johannesburg on Tuesday to meet lottery operator Ithuba representatives.
