After what has been a whirlwind few weeks for Khloe K, the reality TV star has taken to Twitter to thank her fans for their support and to let them know not to worry when she's a bit scarce on the socials. Khloe, who has had even more attention thrown at her since her baby daddy Tristan Thompson cheated on her with her sister's bestie Jordyn Woods, explained that she would return to social media once she's ready to chat again. She called her supporters her blessing and acknowledged the kind words she's received. "Hi loves, wanted you to know that I appreciate you! I’ve been reading your kind words and they really are a blessing to me. I love you! Thank you! I’ll be back when I’m in the mood to chat with you all." Khloe encouraged her fans to be kind to one another as a temporary farewell. Here are the snaps that Tristan liked on Khloe's Insta. Clearly mans is missing the 80% he left for 20% neh?
