It could severely damage our economic and social development ambitions. We need to take bold decisions and decisive action. The consequences may be painful, but they will be even more devastating if we delay."Sunday Times opinion piece In an opinion piece written for the Sunday Times, Ramaphosa said that moves were being made to make Eskom more "efficient". "We are redesigning and repositioning Eskom for the future. This is not about 'privatising' Eskom but separating and balancing operations to make the entity far more efficient. State-owned enterprises must be fully self-sufficient and able to fulfil their developmental and economic roles. This therefore requires that those consuming services, including electricity, must pay for them." Mining Indaba "Restoring energy security for the country is an absolute imperative. We are giving detailed attention to the crisis and challenges that our electricity company, Eskom, faces." Ramaphosa reassured investors at the Mining Indaba in Cape Town amid concerns over Eskom's stability.
