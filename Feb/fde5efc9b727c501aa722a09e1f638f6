President Cyril Ramaphosa has established a special tribunal to enable the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to fast-track the recovery of money and assets lost by state institutions through corruption. The presidency said in a statement on Sunday that the tribunal would "fast-track the finalisation of matters that the SIU refers for civil litigation following conclusion of their investigations". "These are matters where the SIU would have referred to civil litigation contracts entered into by state institutions to be declared irregularly invalid or set aside." Fast-tracking the cases would enable the SIU "to recover monies and or assets lost by state institutions through irregular and corrupt means; thus ensuring that those who are responsible for the loss of monies and or assets by state institutions are held accountable. The litigation process includes both public and private sectors persons and entities." Ramaphosa appointed judge Gidfonia Mlindelwa Makhanya as the president of the tribunal for a period of three years. The additional members appointed to the tribunal are judges: Icantharuby Pillay, Johannes Eksteen, Selewe Peter Mothle, Lebogang Modiba, Thina Siwendu, David van Zyl and Sirajudien Desai. The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that the SIU was probing 11 contractors for allegedly stealing R139bn during the building of Eskomâ€™s Medupi, Kusile and Ingula power plants.
