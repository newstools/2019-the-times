About 500 protesters have barricaded a road with burning tyres at New City in Umzimkhulu, in southern KwaZulu-Natal. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele said that residents were protesting over water issues. He said the the road was blocked with burning tyres and Umzimkhulu police were on scene monitoring the situation. One user, Gatsheni Buyani, shared a picture of the burning barricade saying that the "people are fed up". AnotherÂ user took to Twitter to share his frustration about the protests. "So protesters in Umzimkhulu have barricaded the road to Rietvlei Hospital. This directly prevents patients from being transported to higher-care facilities for investigation and/or further management. How is this beneficial to anyone? I thought we're all about helping people," wrote Ahmed Dindar. Issues relating to water scarcity in the region have been ongoing for several years.
