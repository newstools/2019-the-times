Lamborghini will rip the top off the Huracán EVO for the Geneva motor show next week, creating the Huracán EVO Spyder. The second of the V10 models in the Huracán EVO lineup, the Spyder will take all of the Evo’s upgrades and extra power in a convertible. The mid-engined Coupe was launched earlier this year and the Spyder will share the same 5.2-litre V10 motor, with its new titanium intake valves. Its engine will pump out 470kW of power at 8000rpm, with its 600Nm of torque arriving at a high 6500rpm, as a clear indicator of its naturally aspirated breathing system. Lamborghini claims the 1542kg car will punch to 100km/h in 3.1 seconds (0.2 secs slower than the fixed-roof version) and run on to 200km/h in only another 6.2 seconds. It claims a 325km/h top speed, with braking from 100km/h to zero achieved in a claimed 32.2 metres. That means it matches the output of the Huracan Performance Spyder, which was revealed at the 2018 Geneva show. Handling tweaks to the Evo Spyder include  the addition of Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale 2.0 which manages the traction and stability controls, rear-wheel steering, all-wheel-drive system and adaptive dampers. Drive modes comprise Strada (or street), Sport and Corsa (track). The electrically operated roof opens in 17 seconds at driving speeds up to 50km/h. An electrically operated rear window can also open to bring more air (and V10 symphony) into the cabin.
