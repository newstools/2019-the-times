Two men thought they were in for easy pickings when they stormed into a barber shop, demanding that patrons hand over their belongings. But one of the customers was an off-duty metro police officer. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer was having none of it. He shot and wounded the suspects, arresting one promptly and chasing after the other. This was revealed by MMC for Public Safety in the City of Johannesburg, Michael Sun. The incident took place on Wednesday. “An off-duty JMPD officer was having a haircut when two armed men stormed the shop in Turffontein and demanded cellphones and car keys. The officer opened fire and shot both suspects. One suspect was arrested on the scene. The other suspect was chased and brought down,” said Sun. A revolver and a toy pistol were seized. "Note to self: Do not mess with a JMPD officer, even when he is having a hair-do," Sun commented. Meanwhile, the JMPD is currently mourning  one of its officers, who was killed while off duty. Officer DJ Manyama was shot dead on February 24 in crossfire during a business robbery in Naturena,  JPMD chief David Tembe disclosed while visiting Manyama’s  family this week to offer his condolences.
