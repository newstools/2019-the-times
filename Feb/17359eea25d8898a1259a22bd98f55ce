Khloe Kardashian has hit out at speculation that she is set to be the next Bachelorette. Responding to the creator of the show, Mike Fleiss, who said that she was "in contention" Khloe did not play games. She told the creator that she was not clickbait and if he did not stop using her name, she would approach her lawyers. News emerged last week that Khloe's baby-daddy Tristan Thompson had cheated on her with Kylie Jenner's best friend, Jordyn Woods. Khloe reportedly ended their relationship, making her single. Undeterred by Khloe's reaction, the Bachelorette creator kept pushing.
