The failure to bring a single state capture case to court is threatening President Cyril Ramaphosa’s investment drive. Five world powers, which are responsible for 75% of foreign direct investment in SA, have submitted a joint memorandum to the presidency warning Ramaphosa about jitters amongst their investors concerning the rule of law in SA.
