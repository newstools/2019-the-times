South African travel blogger and environmental activist Ulrich Janse van Vuuren has taken to Twitter to to distance himself from any involvement in pastor Alph Lukau's "resurrection" video. Janse van Vuuren took to the streets of Twitter on Monday to clear his name after he was mistaken for the white man standing in shock while the Alleluia Ministries pastor brings a "dead" man back to life at a church service, the video of which has since gone viral on social media. The video has been at the receiving end of widespread criticism. It has also been made the subject of numerous memes, with speculation rife that Lukau has been extorting followers in an unregulated industry. In a tweet that has been shared more than 2,000 times, Janse van Vuuren said: "To the people who have been asking and speculating that it's me standing at the back there, I plead innocence!" However, many Twitter users were not convinced that the man in the video, who bears a striking resemblance to Janse van Vuuren, was not him. Some even demanded details of the life-changing "miracle" that Janse Van Vuuren had "experienced". "Here’s the deal, we’ll offer you witness protection but you gotta work with us here. Tell us, what did you see?" one user wrote. Another advised: "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law." Janse van Vuuren even received an offer to join the mean streets of Black Twitter as an  honorary member.
