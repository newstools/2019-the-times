Brazil has bagged bragging rights to being home to the best beach on the planet, thanks to Baia do Sancho, which took pole position in the TripAdvisor Travellers' Choice Awards annual list of the world's top beaches. The ranking is based on the quantity and quality of traveller reviews and ratings for beaches over a 12-month period. Baia do Sancho outranked 352 beaches for the top spot and is described by TripAdvisor members as magical, extraordinary and "paradisiac". The top 10 beaches are distributed throughout the Western part of the world, with the conspicuous absence of any destinations in Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Oceania. Although South Africa failed to crack the nod in the world's best beaches category, our country was fairly well represented in TripAdvisor's 2019 list of the 25 top beaches in Africa. Cape Town's Clifton and Camp's Bay beaches were ranked 9th and 13th respectively, Wilderness Beach on the Garden Route came in at number 10 and Paradise Beach in Jeffrey's Bay took the 24th spot.
