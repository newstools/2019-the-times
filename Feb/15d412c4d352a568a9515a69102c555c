Daniel Mashigo, the acting senior general manager in the primary energy division at Eskom, will testify at the state capture inquiry on Tuesday. On Monday the inquiry heard how then-acting Eskom boss Matshela Koko leaked critical information on internal programmes to people aligned to the controversial Gupta family. Testifying at the inquiry, the parastatal’s board chairman Jabu Mabuza described emails found on Koko’s computer, in which he sent confidential information to known Gupta associate Salim Essa. Meanwhile, the Special Investigations Unit wants President Cyril Ramaphosa to extend its 2009 Bosasa investigation to include evidence that has been brought before the state capture inquiry. SIU head advocate Andy Mothibi said the unit’s governance committee was already monitoring the evidence led at the Zondo commission. He said the SIU was consulting with the treasury about these specific contracts, in order to obtain and validate “contract records, payment records” referred to in the testimony of former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi and other witnesses.
