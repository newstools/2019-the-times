Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has won a court challenge,Â  effectively reinstating him as ANC chairperson in the province. Mahumapelo was sacked, together with his entire provincial executive committee, late last year following a number of disruptive ANC meetings. The ANC then appointed a provincial task team, headed by acting premier Job Mokoro, to lead the party until the May elections. Mahumapelo and his supporters challenged the decision in the South Gauteng High Court last year and judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane on Wednesday ruled in favour of Mahumapelo and his supporters. They   argued  that the ANC national executive committee had disregarded a report by the party's deployee, Obed Bapela, who had warned against disbanding the provincial leadership. They had further argued that the party had not consulted its leadership and members in North West and that the party had failed to give reasons why it was disbanding the provincial leadership. Kathree-Setiloane ordered that Mahumapelo and his PEC be reinstated and that the ANC pay legal costs.
