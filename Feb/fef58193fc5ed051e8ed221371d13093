The journey ended abruptly for an unruly passenger who caused a commotion on a minibus taxi and was promptly thrown out of the vehicle in Johannesburg. Netcare 911 responded to reports of a pedestrian collision on the corners of Main and Lonehill Boulevard on Saturday night. "Reports from the scene indicate that an adult sustained minor injuries after he was thrown out a minibus taxi for allegedly being intoxicated and causing fights with the passengers," said Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst. The man was assessed by paramedics and found to be in a stable condition. He declined ambulance transportation to hospital.
