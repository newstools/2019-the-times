South Africa have been drawn in a tough Group F at the 2019 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Poland and will have to content with Portugal‚ Argentina and South Korea in their pool. It is just about the toughest draw coach Thabo Senong could have feared and the side will have their work cut out to qualify for the round of 16. Portugal are the current European champions and have players in the English Premier League and Spanish La Liga‚ as well as from top local clubs Benfica and FC Porto. Argentina were runners-up in the South American qualifying‚ from which Brazil failed to earn a berth‚ and have in their squad 17-year-old Thiago Almada‚ viewed as the next big thing in Argentine football. South Korea were runners up in the Asian confederation and will combine all the best attributes of teams from that region‚ organisation‚ technique and pace. Amajita will open their campaign against Argentina in Tychy on May 25‚ before a clash against South Korea at the same venue three days later. Their final pool game will be against Portugal in Bielsko-Biała on May 31. The top two teams and the four best third-placed sides from the six pools advance to the round of 16. Amajita competed in South Korea two years ago but managed just a single point from their pool play‚ after losses to Japan and Italy‚ and a draw with Uruguay. It is the fourth Under-20 World Cup for the side with their best result a round of 16 place in Egypt in 2009. That side contained the likes of Darren Keet‚ Thulani Hlatshwayo‚ Ramahlwe Mphahlele‚ Kamohelo Mokotjo‚ Thulani Serero‚ Andile Jali‚ George Maluleka‚ Kermit Erasmus and Dino Ndlovu. 2019 FIFA Under-20 World Cup draw Group A Poland Colombia Tahiti Senegal Group B Mexico Italy Japan Ecuador Group C Honduras New Zealand Uruguay Norway Group D Qatar Nigeria Ukraine USA Group E Panama Mali France Saudi Arabia Group F Portugal South Korea Argentina South Africa
