The school pupils arrested in connection with the fatal beating of aspirant musician Thoriso Themane have been remanded in custody until their case resumes in seven days' time. The teens aged between 15 and 16 made a brief appearance behind closed doors in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Five pupils were arrested after the weekend assault on Themane. A sixth suspect was arrested on Thursday morning. More arrests are believed to be imminent. Limpopo MEC for Transport and Community Safety, Makoma Makhurupetje, said the case is being given priority by law enforcement. A task team headed by the police has been instituted to tackle crime in the province. This comes as a petition and social media campaign has been launched to ensure justice following the murder, allegedly by a teenage gang. Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to attend the funeral of Themane, 27.Â  Details of this are not yet confirmed.
