Benni McCarthy has praised the way the Mamelodi Sundowns supporters rally behind the Brazilians and described their devotion to the team as “something to envy.” The Cape Town City coach was speaking after his team went down 3-2 to Sundowns at Loftus on Wednesday with the Brazilians’ supporters fanatically cheering the team to a victory that propelled Pitso Mosimane’s men to the top of the Absa Premiership. “I think they deserved it you know‚” said McCarthy in his TV post-match interview after the defeat. “And I think that the fans that they have‚ the way these guys get behind their team is just remarkable.” The Sundowns fans have in recent seasons made life difficult for visiting teams at Loftus or Lucas Moripe Stadium and it was no different on Wednesday as they cheered the Brazilians to a dominant display that saw them take ownership of the log standings for the first time this season. “It is something to envy from the Sundowns fans. "As an opponent coming here it is so special to see how these Sundowns fans support their team‚” added the 41-year-old McCarthy. “I have to give it to them. Thumbs up to them and they have to continue to set the benchmark in South African football‚” said McCarthy. Sundowns’ supporters’ passion for their team is obvious for all to see from the stands and have made it a habit to often stay behind to chant for the players and coaching staff long after the final whistle. They have jumped on the bandwagon of Iceland’s breathtaking “Viking Clap” chant that left the world in awe at the Euro 2016 and they execute it with such spine-chilling precision.
