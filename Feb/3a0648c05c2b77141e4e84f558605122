A Durban woman accused of discarding her newborn baby down a stormwater drain is expected to make a bid for bail in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's court on Wednesday. Baby Sibanisethu, named by the community, was plucked from a stormwater drain in Newlands East in a dramatic four-hour rescue two weeks ago. Her mother, who is facing a charge of attempted murder, was arrested in hospital last week. On Wednesday the public gallery of Court B was packed with family and friends of the woman. Clutching a water bottle, she sat in the witness box, seemingly anxiously awaiting her turn to apply for bail. She was transferred from hospital to Westville Prison. This is a developing story.
