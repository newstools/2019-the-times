One of the five people wounded in a mass shooting at the Durban flat of an off-duty cop has died. This brings the number of people killed in the incident to four, including the off-duty constable. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele confirmed to TimesLIVE on Tuesday that one of the five people injured in the shooting had died. "Another victim died in hospital last night. Police are now investigating three counts of murder, one inquest case and four attempted murders," said Mbele. "The remaining wounded are still in hospital." Nine people were in the flat when neighbours heard an argument around midday on Monday, followed by several gunshots. Neighbours described the cop, who has not been named, as someone who was known to have a "short temper", especially when he was drinking with friends.
