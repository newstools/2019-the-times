After a cold war that could have frozen the Karoo, comedian Lasizwe and actress Pearl Thusi have finally put their beef back in the freezer. The pair bumped into each other at the Comedy Central roast of rapper AKA on Thursday night in Johannesburg. TshisaLIVE was there to observe as the pair seemed at first to just breeze past each other with their respective entourages with no real interaction. However, posting a picture backstage, Lasizwe revealed that the pair had actually got over their issues and said all was forgiven. The pair fell out two months ago over a Beyoncé video. It started when Queen Bey finally shared a video of her concert in SA and even used DJ Maphorisa's song, iWalk Ye Phara, as her background soundtrack. That was when Lasizwe joked that Maphorisa's song sounded "nicer" now that it had been recognised by the OG Queen B. Pearl soon came in with her two cents and a lecture on over-glorifying "international validation". Lasizwe responded by asking her if she didn't travel all the way to America to seek the same validation she appeared to be shooting down. Yah, neh! Glad that's one petty beef sorted. Over to you, Mufasa and Super Mega...
