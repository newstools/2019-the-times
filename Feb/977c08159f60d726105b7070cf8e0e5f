The DA has asked its federal legal commission to investigate the conduct of one of its councillors who allegedly "hijacked" a sports facility that was meant for public benefit in Johannesburg. The commission is the body that conducts disciplinary proceedings against senior members of the party. DA Gauteng chairperson Mike Moriarty said in a statement on Sunday that the conduct of Alex Christians - ward councillor for Mayfair, Fordsburg and Pageview – may have brought the party into disrepute. The City of Joburg’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS) conducted an investigation into allegations of corruption and bribery in Ward 58. "Allegations of deception, collusion and overreaching were made against Christians regarding the rehabilitation and development of the Mayfair Bowling Club," said Moriarty. "It is alleged that Christians used his influence as a councillor, to have the usage of the Mayfair Bowling Club by an organisation known as Task Academy regularised. This was in spite of a proposal by the Johannesburg Development Agency to use the property for public benefit. "These allegations have been around for some time and the party had determined to await the publication of any findings of GFIS. Now that these findings are in the public domain, the matter must now proceed through disciplinary processes." The forensic probe suggested that Christians had violated the councillors' code of conduct. "In short, the councillor may have brought the party into disrepute," said Moriarty. The Daily Maverick reported on Friday that the councillor's conduct had allegedly cost the city more than R2m. The bowling club has since fallen into a state of disrepair.
