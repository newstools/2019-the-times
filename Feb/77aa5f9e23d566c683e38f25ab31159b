Police are yet to confirm whether an off-duty metro constable - who was one of three people that died during a shootout in the Durban city centre on Monday - was the man who pulled the trigger. Two men and a woman died at the Teesav block of flats on JN Singh Road, behind the Durban high court, at around midday. Five others suffered injuries ranging from moderate to critical at the flat, which is owned by the cop, whose name is known to TimesLIVE. A sixth person managed to escape without injury. SAPS spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the injured - three females and two males - were transferred to hospital for further treatment. When questioned on speculation that the constable was the shooter, Mbele responded: "What I can confirm is that one of the deceased was a metro cop and that it was his flat. Beyond that, I can't confirm anything further as police are still investigating." A firearm was taken from the scene. Metro spokesman Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad would not confirm the identity of the shooter or the constable. "We have protocols to follow and his next of kin has to be informed," he said, adding thatÂ a more detailed statement would be released in due course. Neighbours have meanwhile described the metro cop as someone who loved drinking and often entertained friends. They said there had been a group of people in the flat on Monday when an argument broke out, shortly before several gunshots went off. One neighbour reportedly told media that the policeman was known to have a "short temper", especially when he was drinking with friends.
