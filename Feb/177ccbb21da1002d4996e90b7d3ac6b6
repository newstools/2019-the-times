Public Protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane is set to name and shame state organs  who defy her directives on Thursday, as this has reached "unacceptable levels". "With more than 50 such cases, the problem has reached unacceptable levels. It is for this reason that Mkhwebane is calling a media briefing, where she will name and shame the culprits," her office said. "Regrettably, Mkhwebane continues to contend with dozens of cases where she has taken appropriate remedial action as empowered by the constitution and yet the implicated organs of state – well aware of the Constitutional Court judgment referred to above – neither implement her directives nor take her on judicial review and seek a court order suspending implementation." Mkhwebane claimed thousands turn up at the Public Protector's offices "as a last resort, having tried their best to find justice on their own". "Worse, these are mostly people who would never take the state to court due to the prohibitive financial costs involved," Mkhwebane said. "They come to us knowing that we provide a free service and that we make binding decisions." She added that if the state does not oblige the public loses faith, which "our constitutional democracy cannot afford".
