The City of Cape Town is offering a R50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of suspects after a triple shooting on the N2 highway on Monday. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said suspects wounded two metro police officers and a motorist on the N2 inbound near Borcherds Quarry around 2am. The officers had gone to the area after camera operators detected rocks on the highway. “Officers responded, but in the meantime a motorist drove over the rocks and stopped on the side of the road to attend to a burst tyre. While doing so, another vehicle pulled over and one of the occupants shot the motorist. "When the metro police duo arrived on scene and enquired about what had happened, the suspects opened fire on them too.” One officer was shot in her left leg, the other in his right thigh and the left side of his groin. Both officers are 44 years old and recovering in hospital. “The shooter fled with a firearm belonging to one of the officers, a radio as well as some personal effects. At this stage, we are not certain about the condition of the motorist who was shot, but our thoughts are with him and his family.”
