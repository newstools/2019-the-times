For their first solo exhibition with Southern Guild, designers Adriaan Hugo and Katy Taplin of Dokter and Misses have launched a series of collectible furniture inspired by the creative disorder and decay of urban ecosystems. The multidisciplinary designers are known for their modernist lines, bold colour and shape and distinctive silhouettes. This time, however, they've gone further into conceptual territory with the aim of "communicating the feeling of being in an environment rather than the actual environment itself". The exhibition, Practically Everywhere, largely features sculptural cabinets in timber, steel and glass; the designs explore proportion, form and surface treatments. The duo explain: "Smooth surfaces are interrupted by jagged lines and unconscious gestural marks. Function is encapsulated and overgrown by clumps of irregular forms. Traditional furniture and structural configurations are turned inside out and decorated with dysfunctional clutter. Negative spaces become a nest for 3D visual noise." Influenced by their surroundings — the pair is based in Joburg and the inner city is a constant source of inspiration — Hugo and Taplin conceived this collection as an abstracted study of the urban ecosystem as it adapts to and is overtaken by natural forces. Where others might see ruin, the designers explore the evolving beauty of nature reclaiming the city. • Practically Everywhere is on at Southern Guild in Cape Town until May 8.
