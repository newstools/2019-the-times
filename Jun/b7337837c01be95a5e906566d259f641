Forget the drama around her relationship with Tristan Thompson, the real spice in Khloe Kardashian is those bags she just got as a gift. If you didn't know, Khloe's full names are Khloe Alexandra Kardashian, making her initials KAK. And in 2019 Mzansi that ish is kak funny! It got funnier when Khloe got a bag from her sister Kourtney's new lifestyle website and e-commerce company, Poosh, with her initials on it. She posted a snap of the bag on Instagram Live this week to show it off. But over in the deep south of Africa the internet was a mess with hilarious reactions to the post. We wonder if she'll be allowed on SAA with those. LOL!
