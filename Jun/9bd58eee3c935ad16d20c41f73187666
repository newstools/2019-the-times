DJ Black Coffee took a trip down memory lane to reminisce on how surreal it was when he met Drake for the first time. Black Coffee said that Drake walked up to him, held his hand down and said "Legend". "When I met Drake I thought I would lose my mind." The globally recognised house music DJ added that he's met everyone that he's wanted to except Stevie Wonder.
