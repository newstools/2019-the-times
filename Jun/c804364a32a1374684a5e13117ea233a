Worldwide, women  are responding to a fat-shaming article published earlier this week by  British daily newspaper The Telegraph. Earlier this month, Nike redesigned the women's floor of its flagship shop in London, introducing plus-size and para-sport mannequins for its sportswear displays. Many dubbed the brand's recently expanding range of sizes "historic", because it recognised  that women of all sizes work out. However, journalist Tanya Gold didn't feel that way. In the article, she called Nike's new plus-size mannequins "a dangerous lie", "obese" and "gargantuan". She said overweight people were not interested in fitness and said they should be ashamed of being fat. Here is a snapshot of  reactions to the  article: "I look like that Nike mannequin, and I’ve done a 10k, a half, and a marathon this year," said one woman. "If we cannot see ourselves in something, then the world don't think we exist," said a woman from New York. "Still want to tell me my body type can't run?"  asked another. "You can still be thin and very unhealthy. Size does not fully determine health," a woman in Chicago said. "People wonder why fat people don't feel welcome in the fitness space - THIS IS WHY!," said a woman in California. 'That woman who wrote the @telegraph article needs therapy and I pray she finds peace," said a woman in Illinois. "We're told multiple times  a day, every single day, that our bodies are only considered worthy if we shrink ourselves," said one woman from Florida.
