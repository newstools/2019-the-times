The state of the nation address (Sona) is typically one of the highlights of the political calendar. In February this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered a memorable address, peppered with jokes as well as serious statements about the achievements and plans of his government. He also proclaimed the election date, an election which the ANC once again won. But that doesn’t mean that 2019’s second Sona will be a rehash - Ramaphosa has election promises to deliver on and people to impress. It should be compelling viewing and it’s an essential watch for every engaged South African. But what to do if you’re not in front of your TV on Thursday night? Sona will be showing on several DStv channels and can also be live-streamed on DStv Now.
