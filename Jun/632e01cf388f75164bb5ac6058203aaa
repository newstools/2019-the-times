One suspect died and eight other suspects were arrested after police foiled a cash-in-transit heist in Johannesburg on Friday afternoon. Five other suspects are still being sought by police. “Following an intelligence driven operation, police thwarted plans by a group of men who had allegedly planned to execute a heist at Evaton Mall in the Vaal,” police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said. “A chase ensued between the suspects and the multi-disciplinary team which led to a shootout. As a result, eight suspects were arrested. One male suspect died after one of the vehicles caught fire after crashing into a home in Sebokeng. Two suspects were taken to hospital under police guard.” Police found two rifles, three magazines and recovered five cars, including a BMW X1, Volkswagen kombi, Volkswagen Polo Vivo, Tata India and the burned-out Audi S5.
