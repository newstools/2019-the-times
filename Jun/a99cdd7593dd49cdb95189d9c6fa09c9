Hooks are one of the most under-rated storage items, in my opinion, and I am always astounded at the lack thereof in any space - especially hotel rooms. A hook can serve multiple purposes in any space, particularly in smaller spaces where storage is limited. Whether it's used for obvious things like bags, scarves, hats, blankets or towels or less obvious things like art, planters, lights or even chopping boards - there is no limit to what you can hang, provided the hook is strong enough to hold the weight of the chosen object and is installed correctly. All those renters out there who are hesitant to drill a hole into the wall, there's nothing a little Polyfilla won't cover up. It may not even be necessary as your landlord might welcome the idea of adding additional storage options to a room. 1. Decide what you are going to use the hook for and whether it will be a d√©cor accent or purely functional - though I believe they go hand in hand. If you need inspiration, Pinterest always has helpful ideas. 2. Carefully establish the height, position and spatial limitations within the space, ie. door to wall spacing, etc. A tape measure and a little common sense will come in handy here. 3. Once you have the hook in hand, make sure you have the correct drill bit, a spirit level, pencil - and patience. You don't want to rush and end up having to redo it later. Or, even worse, have something fall off the wall in the middle of the night!
