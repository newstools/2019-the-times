This winter, Mickey and Minnie Mouse are bringing the most magical moments from across the Disney kingdom to Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town and Pretoria when Disney on Ice Presents Magical Ice Festival skates into SA in June and July. Join royal sisters Anna and Elsa from Frozen and their companions in a story full of action, adventure and magic; experience The Little Mermaid with a show-stopping performance by Sebastian and Ariel; get tangled up with a chorus of harmless hooligans when they get a visit from Rapunzel; and be swept away by Beauty and the Beast as the Beast and his castle’s enchanted entourage take centre stage in a spectacular show for Belle. The show runs at Time Square, Menlyn Maine, Pretoria from June 14 to 17; at Joburg's Ticketpro Dome from June 22 to 30; at Durban’s ICC Arena from July 3 to 7; and at GrandWest, Cape Town, from July 10 to 14.
