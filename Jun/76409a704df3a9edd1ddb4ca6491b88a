Motorists get a break as weaker international oil prices allow for a drop in local fuel prices The price of 93 octane petrol will go down by 96c/l on Wednesday, the central energy fund said late on Friday. The rand depreciated against the dollar during the period under review, but this fall was offset by a drop in international oil prices, the fund said. The price of 95 octane petrol will fall by 95c/l, while that of the two grades of diesel will go down by 74c/l and 75c/l, for 0.05% and 0.005% sulphur content, respectively. The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin is to go down by 57c/l, while the maximum retail price for liquid petroleum gas will be reduced by R1.33/kg. The new inland price for 93 octane petrol will be R15.61/l from Wednesday, while that of 95 octane will be R15.81/l. BusinessLIVE
