A motorist allegedly killed himself after he rear-ended another vehicle on the N3 near Howick on Saturday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the motorist, who was driving a bakkie, apparently hit the back of the other vehicle on the freeway in the vicinity of the Merrivale on-ramp. "The vehicle was slightly damaged. "The bakkie driver allegedly took out a firearm and shot himself after the accident," said Mbele. She said Howick police had opened an inquest docket and were investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
