Mpumalanga police are investigating three murders on the same day in Vosman, near Emalahleni, on Monday. One man was found dead at a clinic on Monday afternoon after being stabbed to death. A second man – also stabbed – was found in a pool of blood in a house. These two incidents were reported within 40 minutes of one another. Police received a third call at about 11pm concerning a man who had been shot dead near a hostel in the area. Police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said it was not clear if the murders were linked. “Anything is possible. It could be the same group of suspects; it could be isolated incidents. We don’t know for now,” he said. “The motive behind the killings is still unknown and no arrest has been made as yet.”
