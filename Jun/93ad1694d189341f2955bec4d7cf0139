Key midfielder Dean Furman will not be available due to a knee injury for Bafana Bafana's must-win second Africa Cup of Nations Group D game against Namibia at Cairo's Al Salam Stadium on Friday night. Furman sat out South Africa's last two training sessions with a twisted knee. Both teams need a win in the Southern African derby match (kickoff 10pm). Bafana began with 1-0 defeat against Ivory Coast on Mondayâ€š also at Al Salam Stadium. Namibia started with a 1-0 loss against Morocco. The top two teams and four best third-placed finishers from six groups reach the last-16.
