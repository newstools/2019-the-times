The Zondo inquiry into state capture will continue to hear testimony from former head of financial risk management at South African Airways (SAA) Soraya Stimpel on Friday. The commission is also expected to hear aviation-related testimony from director of Grissag AG Pieter van der Merwe. Former SAA  head of treasury Cynthia Stimpel told the  inquiry on Thursday that former SAA  chairperson Dudu Myeni and her board may have flouted procurement regulations when appointing a little-known company to source R15bn for the airline in 2015. Stimpel, who was SAA's acting group treasurer at the time, said the two options  her team recommended to the board  after an extensive procurement process  were  ignored. Instead, the board ordered that SAA appoint the Free State Development Corporation to provide the funds for SAA's capital-restructuring project.
