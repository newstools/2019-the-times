Social media was left abuzz on Thursday after musician Mshoza posted a video claiming to be worth more than R500,000. Mshoza said it's important for the people who ask her out to be aware that she is "expensive". "Me, just when I am naked, with this body and that's before I wear the bra and the panties, I am worth more than R300,000. That is just my breast, bum, nose. I am worth R500,000 actually, when I think of the nose," said Mshoza. Many of the reactions were hilarious as some said they had lost all "hope" being with the kwaito star. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions.
