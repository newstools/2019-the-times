Between the British royal's famously expressive faces and Donald Trump's OTT personality, it was a state visit made for memes. Wednesday marked the end of the US president's official three-day visit to the UK where he, together with his wife, Melania, and some of his children, hobnobbed with the likes of Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. On Monday Trump tweeted, "London part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic". However, some social media users weren't convinced that the royals were as enthusiastic about spending time with Trump as he was with them: Others poked fun at Trump's wardrobe choices and, of course, his infamous hairdo: The First Lady's attire was also in the firing line. Some thought Mrs Trump saw the trip as a chance to play dress up: Others found Trump's daughter Ivanka's choice of fascinator well, fascinating: But it was the creepy way she and her husband, Jared Kushner, stared out of a window at Buckingham Palace that really captured the internet's imagination: Regardless of whether the royals were pleased to spend time with the Trumps or not, we're certainly glad they did — the trip gave the internet lots to chuckle about.
