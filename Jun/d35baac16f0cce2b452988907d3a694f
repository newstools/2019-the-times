Outgoing DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe has come out in support of proposals for the position heâ€™s departing to be stripped of some of its authority, saying it was just too powerful. Selfe, who has occupied the position for 19 years, said he backed the idea that some of his current functions and powers should be shared with other leaders in the DA.
