DA leader Mmusi Maimane's "silence" on Helen Zille "invalidating" Phumzile van Damme'sÂ  alleged first-hand experience with racism at the V&A Waterfront last week has landed him in hot water, as tweeps continue to call him out for not taking a stand. Some have acknowledged that Maimane may have said something behind closed doors, while others have  called for  a  statement on the issue. The spat between the two saw Van Damme drop files on how Zille allegedly faces no consequences from the party over her statements on social media. She cited Zille's infamous colonialism tweets as an example. Then fire rained down on Maimane.
