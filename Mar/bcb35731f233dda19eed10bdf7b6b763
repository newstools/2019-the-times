Babes Wodumo has had a rollercoaster month and has thanked her friendÂ Nelisiwe Sibiya for helping her find peace in the storm with her music. Nelisiwe is in the box of national treasures with her angelic voice and after seeing her friend make the news for more than a week straight decided to send her a video of herself singing to cheer Babes up. Babes was touched by the gesture and shared the video on her own social media pages this week. In a series of comments she thanked Nelisiwe for always being there for her. Babes and her ex-boyfriend Mampintsha hogged headlines last week after video footage of him slapping the Wololo star several times went viral. He was later arrested, charged with assault and released on R2,000 bail. Mampintsha later laid a counter charges of assault against Babes.
