"It’s no longer a fable; it’s the lived reality of our people - and we are going to take steps to change the situation, because our people deserve the best." That is what President Cyril Ramaphosa promised on Monday during his journey on a train from Mabopane to Pretoria. "I’m rather glad that I came. I’ve seen for myself," Ramaphosa told eNCA. The president, along with Gauteng premier David Makhura and ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula, boarded the train around 7.30am from Mabopane - but it was delayed by two hours. En route the train got stuck again. Some commuters disembarked in frustration. The delays meant Ramaphosa was late for his meeting with the ruling party’s top six. The president eventually arrived at Pretoria station around 10.45am. "Levels of frustration are quite high, but the people are surprisingly patient - patient because they are hoping that the ANC will see what’s happening and bring about changes," said Ramaphosa.
