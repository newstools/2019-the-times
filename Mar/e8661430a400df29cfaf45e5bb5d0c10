Rugomwa is from Rwanda and works as a Taxify driver in Cape Town. He went missing on Wednesday last week. His car was found dumped in Langa. Taxify SA country manager Gareth Taylor said earlier on Monday: "Taxify’s high-priority team was activated and has been cooperating fully with the police to aid in the missing persons investigation." After being found in hospital, local tour operator Pancras Malani tweeted: "Thank you all for your help and prayers. Rodrigue is found alive at Groote Schuur Hospital."
