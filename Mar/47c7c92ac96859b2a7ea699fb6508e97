Khloe Kardashian is furious after the airing of an interview with Jordyn Woods on Red Table Talk, calling bs Jordyn's story that she didn't cheat with Tristan Thompson. Jordyn was interviewed by longtime family friend and host of Red Table Talk, Jada Pinkett Smith. She admitted that Tristan, who is Khloe's baby daddy, did kiss her, but said that there was "no tongue" and she ain't no homewrecker. Jordyn said she never felt uncomfortable at Tristan's house as they were with a group of friends and it was only when she was leaving and he kissed her, did she feel uneasy. Khloe, however, just isn't buying it. She has called Jordyn out on Twitter, insisting that she is not telling the truth. Khloe's angry response has received mixed reaction on social media. Loyal fans are supporting her in her anger, while other people are claiming that she should be the bigger person and not let the Kardashian wrath be unleashed.
