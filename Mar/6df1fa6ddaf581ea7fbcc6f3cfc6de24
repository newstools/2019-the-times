South Africans should brace themselves for another bout of stage 4 load-shedding as power utility Eskom battles to meet electricity demand. Eskom said it would implement stage 4 load-shedding on Wednesday from 9am to 11pm. "This is due to a shortage of capacity,” Eskom said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Stage 4 load-shedding, according to Eskom, calls for 4,000MW to be rotationally shed nationally at a given period. “Load-shedding is a highly controlled process, implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout. During stage 4 load-shedding approximately 80% of the country’s demand is still being met," said the parastatal. Eskom said maintenance teams were working “around the clock” to return generation units to the grid. “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience in this difficult period,” added Eskom.
