A poll by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) has found that 51% of ANC voters are "very unsatisfied" with the national government's performance on fighting corruption. But, the poll found that 47% of ANC voters still believed the party was the best – out of the ANC, DA and EFF – at fighting corruption. Many voters believed the EFF was the best at fighting corruption. "Among all voters, across five of the six issues at a national level, the ANC is selected as the party best placed to deliver on that particular issue. The only exception, as a national issue, is fighting corruption, on which a majority of all voters (30.1%) stated that the EFF would do the best job," the IRR said. These were the findings in the IRR's second tranche of results from their February 2019 election poll. The IRR's Michael Morris said it was fully demographically representative and comprised only registered voters. A total of 1,611 respondents were questioned. The national margin of error was 3.3%. According to the poll the ANC has a negative net satisfaction score among all voters on economic growth, crime, education, healthcare, corruption and land reform. Voters scored the ANC negatively on economic growth (-56%), crime (-41%), education (-11%), healthcare (-13%), corruption (-45%) and land reform (-22%). The poll found that black voters gave marginal positive scores on education (5%) and health care (3%). The highest dissatisfaction rates were recorded among minority ANC voters and DA voters. Morris said a significant number of ANC voters had a "deep unhappiness" with the party's national government performance, while a second group still believed the party was the best. In the IRR’s poll in December 2018, the ANC had 56% of the vote, the DA 18% and the EFF 11%. In the most recent poll, conducted from February 12 to 26, DA support increased to 21.8% and the EFF to 12.2%.
