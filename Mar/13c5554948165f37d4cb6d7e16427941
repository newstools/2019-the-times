A schoolgirl who was hit by a taxi that killed three of her friends in Durban on Wednesday is in a stable condition in hospital. Rescue Care paramedic Garrith Jamieson said he visited the Newlands East schoolgirl on Friday. "She still is in the intensive care unit (ICU) but is stable and in good spirits," he said. The girl and three others were walking to school on Wednesday morning when a taxi driver allegedly jumped a red robot and ploughed into them. The vehicle dragged the girls for several metres before coming to a stop. Ayanda Mtshali, Thima Ngiba, both 14, and 13-year-old Luyanda Ngubane died on the scene while the fourth girl was taken to hospital. On Thursday taxi driver Siboniso Bethell Zwane, 32, appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on three counts of culpable homicide and one of reckless and negligent driving. He handed himself over to police on Wednesday after fleeing the bloodied scene where the bodies of the three girls lay on a main road in Newlands East. He abandoned the vehicle at the scene. Zwane is expected to apply for bail on March 13.
