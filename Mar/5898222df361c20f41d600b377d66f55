A mother’s daily routine of bathing and dressing her 7-year-old daughter led to a shocking discovery when she noticed that her little girl had been raped - allegedly by her 30-year-old stepfather. This while the girl's mother was asleep. Police said the stepfather had been arrested after allegedly sexually assaulting the girl on Saturday night. "It is alleged that the mother became aware of the incident when she was supposed to dress her daughter, then noticed that the girl was injured between her legs. "A case of rape is being investigated by the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit," said police spokesperson Sgt Tsietsi Lamola. The incident is believed to have happened at the couple's rented room in Tshwane East while the mother had been sleeping, according to the police's preliminary investigation. Lamola said the stepfather was expected to appear in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court this week.
