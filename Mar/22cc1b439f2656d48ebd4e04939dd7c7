Eskom continued with stage 2 load-shedding on Saturday, having downgraded the rolling blackouts from stage 4 on Friday. The electricity parastatal said that due to a shortage of capacity, stage 2 load-shedding would be in place from 9am to 11pm on Saturday. It said on Friday that maintenance teams were working round the clock in an effort to return generation units to the national power grid. The reported restoration of the power line from the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric scheme in Mozambique, which was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Idai, means that Eskom will be receiving an additional 900 megawatts of power, enabling it to ease load-shedding.
