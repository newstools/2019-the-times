A police dog has been shot after it attacked an officer's child at the Soshanguve dog unit north of Pretoria on Friday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the dog got out of one of the cages and attacked the child. Dlamini said an officer then shot the dog. "There will also be an internal investigation to determine the member's conduct as well as to establish how the dog got out of its cage," he said. Dlamini said the child was taken to hospital and had since been discharged. He said the dog survived and was taken to a vet. Dlamini said a case of malicious damage to state property has been opened.
