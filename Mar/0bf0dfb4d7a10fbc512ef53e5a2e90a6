Two women have been arrested in connection with a hijacking on Monday in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg, in which a toddler was taken along with his father's car. The three-year-old boy was later found unharmed inside the Toyota Corolla, which was  abandoned between Ennerdale and Finetown hours after the hijacking. SAPS spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the vehicle was hijacked at 1am at Weilers Farm and later found abandoned at Thulamntwana informal settlement. "The child was attended [to] by the paramedics and found to be in good health," said Dlamini. The father of the child had been travelling with his girlfriend when he stopped on the side of the road. Police did not reveal the reason why he had stopped his vehicle. "Two men who came from the nearby bush pointed him with firearms and took the vehicle," said Dlamini. The father and his girlfriend were not injured in the hijacking, but the two hijackers made off with the child still in the car. Commenting on how the two women were linked to the hijacking, Dlamini said: "The suspects are being questioned as they may have conspired with the hijackers. Once they have been charged, they will be taken to the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court, where they may be charged as accomplices to the hijacking." Meanwhile, the search continues for the two male hijackers. "Police are following several leads to arrest them," added Dlamini.
