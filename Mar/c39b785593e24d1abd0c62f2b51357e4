Environmental affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane wants to appear before the Zondo commission to tell her side of the story.Mokonyane said she is willing to give an "honest account" about her relationship with the Watson family. The minister said she wants to testify, and cross-examine and call witnesses to prove that she has nothing to hide.Mokonyane's name has come up in both of Angelo Agrizzi's testimonies at the inquiry. Here is where she has been implicated:R50,000In his testimony on Thursday, Agrizzi said he saw Gavin Watson give Mokonyane a bag of money containing R50,000. Agrizzi said the minister was handed a stack of money on two occasions - in Bryanston and in Roodepoort. Watson family Agrizzi revealed Mokonyane's relationship with the Watson brothers. The former Bosasa executive said he initially learnt about their relationship because of the Watsons' stake in a wind farm in the Eastern Cape. Mokonyane had given a company owned by the Watsons the go-ahead to develop the project on an environmentally protected area. Christmas list Agrizzi alleged that Bosasa organised Christmas gifts for Mokonyane that included alcohol and meat.

The car was allegedly ordered for Mokonyane's daughter. Parties and ralliesIn his first testimony, Agrizzi alleged that Bosasa would foot the bill for ANC rallies and parties. The discussion around that, according to Agrizzi, was between Watson and Mokonyane.Home improvements Agrizzi alleged that Bosasa paid for home improvements for Mokonyane's house in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. Funeral costs Bosasa also paid the costs of funerals for Mokonyane's relatives, according to Agrizzi.
