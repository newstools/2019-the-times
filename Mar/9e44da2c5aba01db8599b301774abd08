A Johannesburg woman eager to avoid her R91,000 power bill has been arrested after repeatedly - and illegally - reconnecting her Bryanston home to the electricity grid. The woman, according to the city of Johannesburg, had been cut off several times for non-payment. But she found a way to get her power back each time. She was arrested on Tuesday and appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court the following day. She was released on R2,000 bail and is due back in court on June 4. "It's alleged ... that an occupant of a house in Bryanston had illegally reconnected electricity to the house. It was further alleged that the occupant had on several occasions reconnected herself with the help of City Power contractors," the city said. "The group forensic and investigation service (GFIS) established that the property owes the City R 91,366.00. It further established that City Power had previously conducted level 3 cut-offs at this property on January 15 and February 13 2019, and the suspect again illegally reconnected herself," the statement continued. According to the municipality, GFIS requested another cut-off from City Power and another level 3 cut-off was conducted on February 24. But the woman again illegally reconnected herself. "The suspect had placed a traditional calabash next to the electric pole in the hopes of deterring City Power officials from cutting off the electricity," the city said. "Corruption has no place in this administration and we will work tirelessly in collaboration with law enforcement agencies to ensure that residents of Johannesburg receive the quality services they deserve," the statement concluded.
