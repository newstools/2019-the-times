Two men were arrested after they were found in possession of explosives at the Beitbridge border post on Friday, police said. Spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe said officers were carrying out search operations at 6.30am when they saw two suspicious men carrying big bags. When theyÂ were stopped and searched they were found to be in possession of connector cap fuses and 900 units of cables with an estimated value of R250,000. It was unclear where they obtained the explosives. "Further police investigations revealed that one of the suspects has also contravened the Illegal Immigration Act for being in the country illegally," Ngoepe said. The two men, aged 25 and 30, are expected to appear in the Musina Magistrate's Court soon.
