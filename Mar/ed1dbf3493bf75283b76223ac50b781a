A burning taxi on the Soweto Highway in Johannesburg on Tuesday contributed to traffic delays. Several videos of the burning taxi shared on social media shows the taxi in flames in the bus lane reportedly near the FNB stadium. Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the taxi caught alight after colliding with a second taxi. "The occupants were able to get out as the one taxi started burning. The number of injuries is not yet confirmed. The cause of the accident will be investigated." This is a developing story.
