ANC national executive committee member and national minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs Zweli Mkhize has urged communities, in pursuit of good governance, to exercise their rights by standing up against greedy and selfish government officials. He was speaking in the Moses Mabhida region on Human Rights Day on Thursday in commemoration of the Sharpville massacre in which 69 people who were marching against dompass were killed by the apartheid government. Addressing a multi-faith prayer service in Mpophomeni township in Howick outside Pietermaritzburg, Mkhize said standing up against greedy and selfish government officials would promote good governance. "We need to stand up to those are in positions so that they can respect their positions so that there is good governance. This will ensure that a person who is presiding over a government institution would know that they are presiding over the heritage of the people who are suffering so that they don't end up being greedy and selfish. "That's why we are fighting corruption and state capture so that there shouldn't be people who, when they have the opportunity, they decide that they should take everything for themselves when communities are expecting something," he said. Mkhize said the government was doing everything to fight corruption because mistakes do happen. "But if we as communities are taking a back seat, there are many things that cannot be resolved," he said. He said while the country was facing many challenges such as a lack of jobs, President Cyril Ramaphosa was doing his best to address them. "We trust the president. We can see the work he is doing," said Mkhize.
