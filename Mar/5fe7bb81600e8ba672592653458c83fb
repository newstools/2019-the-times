Four suspects will appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Monday following a major mandrax seizure after law enforcement officials discovered a clandestine laboratory at a house in Braamfisherville, Soweto. The drugs, seized during a raid by the Hawks' South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB), Crime Intelligence Counter Narcotics and the Gauteng K9 Unit, are believed to be worth millions of rand. The suspects, aged between 35 and 58, will face charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. They were arrested on Friday. Hawks spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the multi-disciplinary team had searched the house and found a clandestine laboratory suspected of being used to produce mandrax.  The drug lab was allegedly in operation when the team swooped, seizing a large amount of mandrax tablets, other chemicals and equipment. “All the four suspects were arrested on the property. The entire haul is suspected to be running into millions of rands.  The correct figures will be released at a later stage.” Hawks national head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya has applauded the team for their tireless and continuous fight against illegal drugs and the continuous dismantling of illicit drug manufacturing laboratories in the country. According to Lebeya, the seizure was a significant one which could prevent  kilograms of mandrax worth millions of rand hitting the streets.
