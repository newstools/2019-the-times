DA MP Phumzile van Damme has claimed that she was assaulted by security guards at Eskom's Medupi Power Station in Limpopo on Wednesday. This, she said, was during a peaceful picket by her party outside the plant. Van Damme said she had laid charges of assault, crimen injuria and unlawful seizure of property at the Lephalale Police Station on Wednesday afternoon. SAPS confirmed that the case was opened. Van Damme said she expected a full apology from Eskom, but said this did not mean she would drop the charges. In a series of tweets, Van Damme explained what happened. The party had decided to picket outside the station to demonstrate against load-shedding. Police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that a case of assault was opened by Van Damme following the "alleged commotion" that took place at the power station at 11.30am. "The security guards allegedly involved in the scuffle had also opened counter charges against her," Mojapelo said. Eskom has not yet commented on the matter. This story will be updated when the power utility issues a statement.
