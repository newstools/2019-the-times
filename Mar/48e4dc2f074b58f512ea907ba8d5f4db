Despite facing sanctions over her tirade against senior government officials, Gauteng MEC for arts and culture Faith Mazibuko has been nominated to represent the ANC in the Gauteng legislature. Mazibuko is number five on the list, guaranteeing her a seat as an MPL after the elections. This comes after Gauteng premier David Makhura chastised Mazibuko for her conduct, saying it was racist and sexist. A leaked recording of the controversial meeting, initially reported on by AmaBhungane, revealed it was about the delivery of sports facilities known as "combi courts". In the audio, Mazibuko's CFO and HoD tried to explain why the facilities could not be delivered ahead of the May 8 elections but she refused to accept their reasons, saying they should pull out all the stops to ensure it was done. She lashed out, saying a reason why other departments chose not to employ Indian and white people was because they liked to speak English. "Which other department has an Indian that is a CFO? Which other one? You are the second one … A woman. You must thank your lucky stars! Which other department has an HoD which is a umlungu [white person]? Ayikho [there is none], including national. So you must thank me for empowering you, so don't sabotage me … You must never! You better do your work or get out," said Mazibuko in the recording. Mazibuko is expected to be hauled before the ANC’s integrity committee to answer for her behaviour. She has since publicly apologised. Makhura tops the ANC list of candidates for the provincial legislature followed by education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Former fees must fall activist Fasiha Hassan has featured on the list of candidates for the provincial legislature.
