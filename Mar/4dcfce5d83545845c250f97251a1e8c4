Die Antwoord's Yolandi Visser has broken her silence on the "beef" between the group and Australian artist Zheani, after the Australian artist apparently accused the group of "trafficking her to SA". Zheani released a diss track aimed at the group last week, where she accused them of "trafficking" her and filling her with "fear". The song caused quite a stir in Australia and among fans of the group on social media, but Die Antwoord were quiet on the claims. According to some on social media, the group also started deleting Instagram comments from those asking about their relationship with Zheani. Eventually Yolandi addressed the claims, taking to Instagram to issue a lengthy statement on the matter. In it, Yolandi claimed that Zheani was just a fan girl looking for clout. "It has come to my attention that a DA (Die Antwoord) fan girl called Zheani has accused me of some really horrible things. I don't usually respond to these things, as people say sh*t about me all the time. But this time she has attacked my family, including my daughter." She confirmed that the group's Ninja had been in a relationship with Zheani in the past and had visited SA with him, but rubbished the claims that the Aussie artist was "trafficked" and made to take part in dodgy rituals. "Just for the record, me and Ninja are Buddhists. We practise yoga, meditate and are vegetarian. Yes, our music and videos are crazy, as we are surreal artists... This is a typical case of clout chasing (google that sh*t)." Yolandi ended her statement by claiming that Zheani had fabricated the story and was using their name to promote her music. "This is the last time I’m mentioning this girl. I wish her good luck with music, but it would have been stronger to set her career off with good energy instead of shooting herself in the foot," Yolandi added.
