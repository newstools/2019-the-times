Durban ratepayers footed the more than R2.5m bill for repairs at the Moses Mabhida stadium after soccer hooligans stormed the pitch in April. This is what Moses Mabhida general manager Vusi Mazibuko told the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday. Mazibuko was testifying during the pre-sentencing of nine people who have been convicted for public violence. Siphosenkosi Knowledge Memela, John Sibongiseni Khumalo, Kwezilomo Madiba, Cebolendoda Hadebe, Douglas Mhlaliseni Mkhize, Nolwethu Cokotha, Zibongile Njova, Sihle Duncan Zungu and Dennis Thusi were arrested Â after invading the Moses Mabhida Stadium pitch and causing havoc at a match between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars in April. The incident left many injured and caused property damage to the tune of R2.6m. All have been barred from attending any sporting fixture or recreational gathering until the finalisation of the trial. Mazibuko told the court that  the match was a PSL fixture so the costs associated with the damage were to be shared between the parties involved, but the stadium had paid for the damage up-front to get the stadium up and running. "The costs should be shared by the partners as per the contractual agreements, but they haven't been determined yet. So the stadium has paid so as to make the stadium operational," he said. When questioned by magistrate Sifiso Luthuli about where the money had come from, Mazibuko said that the stadium was owned by the city and therefore the money came from ratepayers. The matter is still in court.
