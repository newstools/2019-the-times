The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed a Johannesburg High Court decision to deny musician Thulani "Pitch Black Afro" Ngcobo bail in his trial for the alleged murder of his wife, Catherine "Trisha" Modisane. Pitch Black Afro was charged with premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice in January after Modisane's death on New Year's Eve. The star's bail application has been fraught with delays but on Monday magistrate Paul du Plessis said that evidence before the court showed there were no exceptional circumstances for bail to be granted. Speaking after the ruling, NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane said that they welcomed the court's decision. "The NPA is happy with the decision. We are in agreement with the court, as we have argued during the bail application, that Mr Thulani Ngcobo also faces charges of defeating the ends of justice. The state alleges that he tried to conceal evidence at the crime sceneÂ  and therefore there is a likelihood that if released on bail, he will interfere with ongoing investigations." Louw-Mjonondwane pointed to an investigation earlier on in the bail application, where the state requested that the star's address be verified. "Further, he failed to produce a fixed address and therefore the likelhood of evasion of trial was existent in this matter." The matter was postponed to April 12 for a trial date to be set.
