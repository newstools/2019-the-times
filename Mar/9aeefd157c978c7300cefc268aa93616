Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi on Friday afternoon welcomed the dismissal of a sports coach at Bryanston High School who was found guilty of sexually harassing three pupils. The school governing body said that the coach – who is also facing criminal charges – had appeared before a three-member disciplinary panel over the allegations. SGB chair Aidan Hillebrand said the man was found guilty on all counts covering sexual harassment and financial mismanagement. "As a result, the staff member has been dismissed with immediate effect." The department of education said the alleged harassment had allegedly taken place between 2017 and 2018. Spokesperson Steve Mabona said a complaint against the coach was laid in January 2019. "The verdict will ensure that he is struck off the professional roll of educators," Mabona said. Lesufi said the department had a "zero-tolerance stance" on allegations of sexual assault and had never hesitated to act where allegations of this nature were proven true. Lesufi urged learners to report incidents of sexual harassment to their parents, police or any other trusted figure.
