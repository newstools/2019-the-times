One of the two men shot during an attempted gold heist on an Ekurhuleni highway on Tuesday has died in hospital. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the men were injured after being shot by a gang who attempted to rob a goods truck on the R21 near Boksburg. The vehicle was transporting gold. “One of the men is dead. He died in hospital today [Wednesday],” said Makhubele, adding that the other man was in a stable condition in hospital. “The police were on patrol when they were notified of the robbery. When they got to the scene, the suspects shot at the police, went into their vehicles and fled the scene." Police launched a manhunt for seven to 10 men, but by Wednesday there had still been no arrests, said Makhubele.
