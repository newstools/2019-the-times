An awaiting trial prisoner made a daring escape from Westville Prison in Durban while construction work was taking place on Monday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Lt-Col Thulani Zwane told TimesLIVE that the 32-year-old man, Njabulo Lucky Mbatha, had escaped while workers were busy with the construction work. He was awaiting trial following his arrest for housebreaking and theft. "A case of escaping from lawful custody has been opened at the Westville police station for investigation," Zwane said. He said officers from the K9 dog unit were searching for the man.
