The winds might still blow in the favour of controversial Bosasa boss Gavin Watson and his family, provided testimony from former company chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi on Thursday proves to be true. According to Agrizzi, who took the stand at the state capture inquiry on Thursday, the family stands to make a fortune from a wind farm development in the Eastern Cape. And, he said, one of the alleged beneficiaries of payments from Bosasa, environmental affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane, could prove useful in making it happen.
