Two suspects, whom police say are linked to various robberies of Uber and Taxify drivers, have been arrested in the Western Cape. The attacks occurred in the SAPS' Langa precinct, said provincial police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk. The arrests were made after the perpetrators attempted to rob an Uber taxi driver in Zone 5 Langa when they were chased by the local community, who in turn notified the SAPS, said Van Wyk. A 23-year-old woman was the first to be apprehended. Follow up investigations led to the arrest of a 26-year-old suspect. Both are currently in custody. "The suspects can be linked to 15 other Langa cases related to taxi robberies," said Van Wyk. "Investigations determined that fake accounts were created by the suspects for ordering the taxis." The investigation continues. Both suspects are due to appear in court once charged.
