The ANC appears to have fallen for a “fake” digital campaign circulating on social media - purportedly from the EFF - offering free driver's and learner's licences. In a statement on Tuesday, the governing party accused the EFF of using “desperate antics” by offering the free licences in exchange for electoral support. “This despicable act of vote buying must be exposed for what it is and constitutes an illegal act that undermines democracy," said ANC spokesperson Dakota Legoete. "The levels of desperation demonstrated by the EFF are indicative of a party that has accepted that their fortunes at the polls are questionable." Legoate said the ANC believes that offering what amounts to “monetary inducements” to voters, and the use of IEC imagery on party material, is against the law. “The ANC has reported the matter to the IEC and trust that the IEC will decisively deal with this thuggery and blatant abuse of our electoral processes,” he said. When contacted by TimesLIVE, however, a spokesperson for the EFF dismissed the poster as “fake news” and said the the party did not know where it had originated. The IEC had not responded to questions regarding the complaint by the time of publication.
