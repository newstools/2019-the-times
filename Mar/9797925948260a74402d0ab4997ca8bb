A 13-year-old girl was found stabbed in a school toilet in Tlhabane near Rustenburg, North West, police said on Thursday. "Two kids went to the toilet and found the girl lying on the ground. When they tried to talk to her, she was unresponsive," Police spokesperson Lt-Col Amanda Funani said. She said the two pupils alerted the teachers, who then phoned the police. The teen had a stab wound to her stomach. She was transported to hospital. The girl survived the stabbing, which took place on Wednesday. Funani said police were investigating a case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. No arrests had been made. The North West department of education could not immediately be reached for comment. In a separate incident on Wednesday, Kulani Mathebula, a Mondeor High School pupil, was stabbed to death. Kulani was stabbed - reportedly three times in the chest - just minutes after he left home to go to school. Three teenagers have been arrested for his murder.
