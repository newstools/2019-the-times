Going nowhere slowly. That's what happens when you book a flight with Air Zimbabwe. In a statement released on Thursday, the struggling national airline said that its only aircraft, which services all its routes, had to undergo engine repairs and could not be fixed in time. The aircraft went in for repairs last Sunday due to equipment constraints. This resulted in serious disruptions this week as most flights had to be rescheduled. "The rescheduling resulted in adverse effects on our crewing requirements based on the regulated employee duty times that must be adhered to. "For regulatory compliance, the airline was forced to cancel or reschedule some of its flights. Admittedly, this has resulted in serious inconveniences on our valued passengers which we sincerely apologise for," the airline said. It said that it expected normal schedules to resume "within the shortest possible time". "We solemnly and graciously appeal to our valued clients to bear with us during this period. The airline expects delivery of additional equipment soon to ease the current operational challenges." The airline said efforts were under way to ensure that going forward, the national airline was adequately and appropriately equipped for efficient operations. Alternative travel arrangements were being put in place for passengers. Passengers may contact the airline on https://www.airzimbabwe.aero/contact-us to update their contact details.
