There will be R53m left from the original R450m of the 2010 Fifa World Cup Legacy Trust‚ once the R96m allocated to be spent by the SA Football Association (Safa) this year has been disbursed. SA’s share of profit for hosting the World Cup amounted to US$65m‚ and that amount‚ which translated into R452m‚ went into the Legacy Trust. Interest received on that over nine years has been R149m. The expenditure has been R449m‚ leaving R150m. Of that R96m has been dispensed to Safa‚ leaving R53m. The trust paid grants to Safa worth R321mn for various programmes. It has financed Safa’s 52 regions (R31m)‚ associate members (R9.7m) and 311 Local Football Associations‚ or LFAs (R2.7m); and paid to NGOs (R29m) and bursaries (R2.3m). The major expenses involved in the R96m being disbursed to Safa are R19m to junior national teams and R10m to a new national women’s league‚ scheduled to kick off on August 9. There is also R7.5m to Safa’s 52 regions‚ R4.75m to the Football for Hope NGO programme‚ R4.65m for technical officials‚ R5m for LFA junior leagues‚ R5m to the KZN Academy‚ and R8.24m for administration. Safa president Danny Jordaan said the R53m left in the trust is being reinvested. “Of course we are also talking about how we sustain this trust. Because the trust has really produced magnificent results for us‚” he said. Among initiatives Safa has spent its R320m portion of the trust on in the last eight years are: * the establishment and development of Safa’s National Technical Centre at Fun Valley in Olifantsvlei‚ Johannesburg. * the establishment of the KZN Academy in Hoy Park‚ Durban‚ and that academy’s annual tours of Portugal‚ resulting in numerous young products securing products there; * youth leagues (U-13 and U-15 boys and girls) in almost all Safa regions and LFAs; * U-17 and U-19 interprovincial competitions; * Thousands of coaches have been trained; * training of referees; * expansion of women’s football; * the funding the women’s academy at the High Performance Centre at Pretoria University;
