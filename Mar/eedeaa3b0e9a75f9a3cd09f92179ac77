The KwaZulu-Natal prisoner who made a daring escape from the Westville prison in Durban on Monday is back behind bars. KZN correctional services department spokesperson Thulani Mdluli said on Tuesday that Njabulo Lucky Mbatha, who escaped from the prison's awaiting-trial section, was rearrested about 11.30am. He was at the Durban station when he was nabbed by the prison's emergency support team, said Mdluli. On Monday, police and prisons authorities confirmed that Mbatha had escaped while workers were busy with construction work. He was awaiting trial following his arrest for housebreaking and theft.
