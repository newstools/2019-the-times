South Africans will have some reprieve as Eskom implements stage 2 load-shedding from 9am on Friday. “Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented on Friday March 22 2019 from 9am to 11pm. This is due to a shortage of capacity,” the power utility tweeted on Thursday evening. “Load-shedding is a highly controlled process, implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout.”
