South Africans are still in the dark about the future of Eskom's load-shedding crisis, as the state-owned entity battles to maintain the power supply. "When it comes to load-shedding, Eskom is facing maintenance costs, it's facing coal costs, it's facing diesel costs," says Business Times reporter Mudiwa Gavaza. "At the same time ... they have some industrial action going on, so they're also facing the labour costs from there." Gavaza says the impact of load-shedding on business has been substantial. "Some of the big industrial companies have started looking at producing their own power ... so we might see a rise in costs in the way businesses operate, and this might spur on inflation."
