A police chase  ended with the suspect dying when he allegedly stopped to open fire on officers, resulting in one of them firing a fatal bullet, according to Eastern Cape police. A case of murder has been opened and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has been informed. The suspect was identified as Shakoer Mohammed, 26, also known as Jiggley,  who police said was affiliated to the Spotbouer gang. Eastern Cape police said that, as part of operations to combat gang-related murders, the national intervention unit (NIU) deployed in Port Elizabeth's northern areas traced a wanted suspect in Gelvandale on Tuesday. "About 9.30am, members followed up on information and spotted the suspect in Blesbok Street. He started running, with police on his heels. In Hartebees Street, he pointed a firearm at the police, who fired a shot, fatally injuring him," police said in a statement. A revolver was found lying next to him, said the police. Mohammed was wanted by police for the February murder of Remo Januarie, 40. Acting police provincial commissioner Maj-Gen Thembeka Dyantyi said in a statement: "The South African Police Service will be doing everything in its power to ensure that the ongoing gang violence in these areas is stabilised and suspects arrested." She said that since December 2018, "the national intervention unit and provincial tactical response team (TRT) have been assigned to the hotspot areas of Gelvandale and Bethelsdorp. An additional deployment of NIU and special task force joined their counterparts in February 2019. These teams are concentrating on stabilisation of gangsterism, illegal firearms and trio crimes which remain a priority in the province."
