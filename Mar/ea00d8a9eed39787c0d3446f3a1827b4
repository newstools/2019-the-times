However, the actress shared she's since found peace and learnt to accept herself. “I’m the type that can quit their job for love. I hated that about myself before, but with me getting older I've learned to accept my kind and loving heart as a strength. In a previous interview with TshisaLIVE KB said that the 7de Laan role was part of her come back plan to change the way people see her. “I took a year off and decided to focus on my music. At the time I didn’t think I would return to TV‚ never mind a soapie‚ but when 7de Laan called me it immediately felt right. I knew that I had to take the role. It represented not only a new challenge for me but also a chance for people to see me in a whole new light. That is what is most important to me‚” she said. She's been doing a great job on 7de Laan and looks as radiant as they come!
