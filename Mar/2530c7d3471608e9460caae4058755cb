A transformer has exploded at a substation in Pinetown, west of Durban, cutting off power to at least four suburbs. Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said that the fire and electricity departments were on scene and that no injuries were reported. "The electricity department is on scene trying to isolate the power," said Sewpersad. The fire that has created plumes of black smoke in the Pinetown area has cut off electricity to Chatsworth, Northdene and Mariannhill. Metro police head Steve Middleton shared pictures of the fire on his Facebook page. In response several residents also shared their pictures and frustration over the power cut. Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed that a transformer in one of its major substation in Klaarwater has been guttered by fire plunging Chatsworth, Pinetown and greater Queensburgh suburbs into darkness. "eThekwini Municipality sincerely apologises for the inconvenience this will cause to residents. Our teams are at the scene and working unceasingly to restore power as soon possible," saidÂ Mayisela. Almost exactly a year ago, the power station experienced a similar incident resulting in a citywide blackout. The fire was linked to maintenance issues.
