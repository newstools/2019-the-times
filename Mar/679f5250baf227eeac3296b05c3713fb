The SA Human Rights Commission will on Wednesday announce whether EFF leader Julius Malema and other members of the party are guilty of hate speech. The commission said it would release its findings, recommendations and directives on the various hate speech accusations - and discuss the findings in the context of hate speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the press. "The commission will attempt to address the complaints and the alleged rights violations in a comprehensive manner, unpacking and engaging the media on the complexities of the legal principles which determine whether an utterance qualifies as hate speech," the SAHRC said in a statement on Friday evening. The commission added that while "robust" speeches were expected in the build-up to the national election on May 8, "the Commission urges political parties and their leaders to ensure that they exercise due regard and responsible care when addressing supporters or making political statements".
