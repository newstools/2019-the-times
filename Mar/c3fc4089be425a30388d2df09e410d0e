NSRI Simon's Town station commander Darren Zimmerman said the medical response team were alerted to the emergency by a dive charter boat at 11am on Saturday. Zimmerman said CPR was administered to the man who collapsed after surfacing from a scuba dive with his daughter. It is suspected he had suffered a heart attack.
