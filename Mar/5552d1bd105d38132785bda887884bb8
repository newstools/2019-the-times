A judgment for a R4,570 traffic violation in 2011 has escalated into an epic showdown between the National Treasury and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Finance minister Tito Mboweni and the Treasury have accused Mkhwebane of “tarnishing” SA’s image and efforts to increase investment. Mboweni and Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane lodged papers in the high court to review and set aside Mkhwebane’s report that Mogajane acted dishonestly and improperly by not disclosing on his job application that he had a criminal record for a speeding fine. Mkhwebane has retaliated, questioning whether Mboweni has any business interfering in her report. She has also complained to President Cyril Ramaphosa and National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete about Mboweni’s comments about her. Mogajane is facing disciplinary action as a result of Mkhwebane’s findings that he was “blatantly dishonest”. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
