South Africa is at risk of being plunged into darkness - again - on Tuesday evening. Eskom says there is a high risk of rotational load-shedding between 4pm and 11pm, adding that it will be implemented only if absolutely necessary. The latest load-shedding threat is the result of a shortage of capacity due to the loss of generating units at the utility's power stations. Residences and businesses have been urged to use electricity sparingly. Meanwhile, Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said large parts of the Vaal have been left without power after an explosion at a substation in the area. He said the Emfuleni municipality was investigating the cause of the explosion. "Eskom will assist in helping to restore power supply," he added.
