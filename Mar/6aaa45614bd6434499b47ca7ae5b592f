Four suspects linked to a syndicate robbing "meter taxi" passengers at gunpoint have been arrested. "The suspects were allegedly travelling in a white Mazda 323 disguised as a meter taxi and robbed people at gunpoint while transporting them to their destinations," said the Limpopo police's Col Moatshe Ngoepe. "In some instances, some of the victims were forced to swipe their bank cards on a speed-point machine they had, transferring money to their bank accounts." Ngoepe said a multidisciplinary joint task team, comprising various police units in the Lephalale cluster, made the arrests on Monday. The suspects are aged 24 and 25. Two people were caught at Ga-Dikgale village outside Polokwane while the other pair were apprehended in Mahwelereng township outside Mokopane. The suspects will appear in the Witpoort Magistrate's Court soon. The police are appealing to anyone who fell victim to the syndicate to contact them.
