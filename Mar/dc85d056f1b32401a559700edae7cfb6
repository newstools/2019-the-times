Eskom said there is a high risk of stage 1 rotational load-shedding on Tuesday, but it would only be implemented if "absolutely necessary". The load-shedding could be implemented until 10pm. It is the result of a shortage of capacity, due to the loss of generating units at power stations. The power utility has urged residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly. "Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," said Eskom.
