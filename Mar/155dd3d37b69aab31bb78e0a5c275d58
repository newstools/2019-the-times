Police arrested a 42-year-old woman in Spruitview, Ekurhuleni, after she was found with suspected stolen property worth thousands of rand. The items included television sets, microwaves, laptop computers, washing machines, a Honda motorbike and other appliances. The goods were suspected to have been stolen during house robberies and break-ins. Gauteng police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said on Sunday that police stopped the woman as she was coming from Angelo informal settlement in Boksburg on Friday. On searching her car, a number of alleged stolen goods were recovered. She was taken to her home in Spruitview where more suspected stolen goods were found. "An investigation is underway to establish whether or not she could be linked to other cases of house robberies, especially where women were the suspects," Masondo said. She is expected to appear in court on Monday.
