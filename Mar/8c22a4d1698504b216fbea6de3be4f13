Zimbabwe - described as one of SA's top trading partners on the continent - will host a meeting between presidentsÂ Cyril Ramaphosa and Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday. The SA president's office said Ramaphosa will travel to Harare to co-chair the third session of the Bi-National Commission, following a meeting between senior officials from both countries last week. The two countries conduct their bilateral relations through the Bi-National Commission, established in 2015. Both heads of state will review progress made with the implementation of the 45 bilateral agreements signed so far spanning trade and investment, health, labour, migration, defence, taxation, tourism, water and environment. The presidency said: "Trade co-operation between the two countries is at a high level to the extent that SA exports to Zimbabwe in 2018 amounted to approximately R30.8bn, while imports from Zimbabwe amounted to approximately R3.6bn, thus placing Zimbabwe among SA's top trading partners on the continent." "SA and Zimbabwe have good bilateral political, economic and social relations underpinned by strong historical ties dating back from the years of the liberation struggle." Ramaphosa will be accompanied by the international relations and cooperation minister Lindiwe Sisulu, defence and military veterans minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, trade and industry minister Rob Davies, home affairs minister Siyabonga Cwele, and transport minister Blade Nzimande.
