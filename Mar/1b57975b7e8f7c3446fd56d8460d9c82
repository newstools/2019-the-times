Gauteng premier David Makhura visited the family home of murdered Matwetwe actor,  Sibusiso Khwinana, telling the family that suspects have been identified. A task team has been established to investigate the case, comprising of forensic expects and specialised detectives. Makhura said three suspects have been identified but no arrests have been made. Khwinana family members thanked officials for "bringing us comfort" and said they hoped other families affected by crime received the same treatment. The actor was stabbed in Pretoria last week, allegedly over a cellphone. Senior police officials said that even though they have identified suspects, they want to do things by the book and make arrests when they are confident they have all the necessary evidence.
