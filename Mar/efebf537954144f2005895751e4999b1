Limpopo police are searching for a female suspect after a magistrate awoke during an overnight stay in Polokwane last month to find his car and cellphone missing after his drink was allegedly spiked. The magistrate, 44, spent the night in Polokwane on February 23 and booked into an  accommodation establishment with a "female companion whom he allegedly met earlier around town". "It is understood that the victim had a drink. While they were inside one of the rooms and passed out. It is suspected the drink might have been spiked. He was woken up by the employees at around 7am and that’s when he realised his cellphone and a motor vehicle, BMW 3 series, were stolen. His companion had also disappeared," police spokesperson Constable Maphure Manamela said on Wednesday. Police found the stolen car a week later abandoned in Soshanguve, Gauteng. Police asked anyone with information to contact Warrant Officer Issac Ntokola at 076 150 3292.
