A late night raid on the house of an alleged underworld figure and bouncer boss resulted in the seizure of R4/R5 assault rifle magazines, along with South African army clothing. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andr√® Traut confirmed that two people, both aged 49, were arrested in connection with an extortion case. "This office can confirm that two suspects ... were arrested by SAPS at their respective residences in Plattekloof and Parklands last night [Thursday] on charges of intimidation, assault GBH, extortion, kidnapping and blackmailing," said Traut. The men are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday. They cannot be named until they have pleaded. TimesLIVE understands that several firearm magazines were seized in the raid in Plattekloof. TimesLIVE arrived on the scene in Loevenstein on Thursday evening where heavily armed Tactical Response Unit members raided a terraced house in one of Cape Town's most affluent suburbs. The officers donned masks as they searched the property and entered the house, perched on the slopes of a steep hill. Among the clothing seized was insignia from the South African National Defence Force's Infantry School.
