Gauteng police swooped on a drug laboratory in a home in Sandton on Thursday. National police commissioner Gen Khehla Sitole, provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Elias Mawela and Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the house following the bust. Sitole said three foreign nationals were arrested for drug manufacturing. A fourth foreign national, who arrived on the scene after the raid, was arrested after he attempted to bribe officers with R10,000 to "kill the operation". Sitole said the mandrax found was estimated to be worth about R2.5m, while the CAT had an estimated value of R500,000.
