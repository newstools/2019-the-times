The state had barely finished wrapping up its case against Duduzane Zuma in court on Thursday when his lawyer brought an application for the entire matter to be scrapped. The lawyer for president Jacob Zumaâ€™s son believes there is no evidence to show Zuma was driving recklessly in his Porsche 911 Turbo, causing a deadly road accident in 2014. In fact, he has argued the four-wheel-drive crashed because of aquaplaning.
