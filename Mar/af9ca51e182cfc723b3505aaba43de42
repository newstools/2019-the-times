Justice and correctional services minister Michael Masutha told parliament that of the 5,419 sexual offences taken up by the NPA in the 2018-19 financial year, 74% ended in successful convictions. Masutha was replying to a parliamentary question from EFF MP advocate Elphus Mulaudzi on Monday. According to Masutha, Mpumalanga had the highest conviction rate, while  Limpopo had  the lowest. In the financial year under review, Mpumalanga had 381 sexual offences cases that were finalised in court, with 309 convictions and 72 acquittals. Of the 380 cases prosecuted in Limpopo, only 232 led to successful convictions, while 148 accused were acquitted. Limpopo was the only province where the conviction rate in sexual offences cases dropped - from 65% in the 2017-18 financial year to 61% in the financial year under review. The other eight provinces increased their conviction rates, with Mpumalanga leading the pack with a six percentage point  improvement. According to the police, sexual offences involve sex without consent, unwanted sexual touching or being forced to engage in humiliating sexual activity. Civil society organisations have, over the years, decried the under-reporting of sexual crimes for a number of reasons. It is believed that the rate of reporting  sexual offences is now one in 13.
