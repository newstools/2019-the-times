A rhino was poached at the Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve in the Cradle of Humankind, northwest of Johannesburg, on Thursday night - the first ever rhino poaching incident at the reserve. A second rhino was injured, but is likely to survive. The reserve said in a statement it was "devastated" and "angry" - and had increased security to prevent further poaching incidents. It added that it had always known it had a hard balance to manage in enabling people in a city to have easy access to view rhinos while being well aware that a well-advertised and well-known rhino reserve could attract poachers. "We know that we always need to be vigilant. Because of our name, the public knows that we have rhinos in our reserve, which makes them vulnerable. "On the other hand, one of the purposes of the Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve is to make it easier for residents of South Africa's most densely populated urban areas to see wild rhinos. Getting to share these wonderful, gentle creatures with the public is something all of us at the reserve care about very deeply, and we have decided that we will not let criminals stop us from doing something that matters so much." The reserve said it was increasing security. "We cannot divulge any details that would put our animals at risk, but we can assure the public that we will do everything to limit any further poaching."
