Western Cape detective boss Maj Gen Jeremy Vearey is being investigated for kidnapping, torture and defeating the ends of justice, the Sunday Times reported. Vearey, who is the head of detectives in the Western Cape, and Brig Cass Goolam, the station commander in Mitchells Plain, are the subjects of an investigation by counter intelligence officers for allegedly trying to frame two men for the killing of Mervin Jacobs, who was shot dead in 2009. One man was allegedly tortured and told to confess to the murder. Jacobs was allegedly involved in investigating a drug deal in Mitchells Plain. Vearey did not respond to requests for comment, and Goolam referred questions to the police spokesperson, who was unable to confirm the investigation. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
