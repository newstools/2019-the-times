World champion Lewis Hamilton won the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday as Charles Leclerc saw his hopes of a maiden victory shattered by his misfiring Ferrari. Hamilton claimed victory under the safety car in front of Mercedes teammate Valterri Bottas, who won the season-opener in Australia, with pole sitter Leclerc taking third place. Sebastian Vettel, in the second Ferrari, was fifth just behind Max Verstappen in a Red Bull.
