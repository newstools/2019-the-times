Municipal workers clearing a blocked drain on Friday stumbled upon a foetus. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a community member told TimesLIVE that workers were clearing a sewage pipe at business premises in Reservoir Hills, outside Durban, when they uncovered the unborn baby. The drain system became blocked following heavy rain this week. "They informed the security guard who came and told us. We then contacted the police," the community member said. Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said the unborn baby was declared dead on scene. "The baby was assessed by advance life support paramedics but unfortunately was declared dead on the scene." Police have opened an inquest docket.
