A 17-year-old Bloemfontein school pupil died after the wheel of a bakkie hit his head, Free State police said on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said the driver of a white Toyota Hilux informed police that he felt the bakkie losing balance. "He wasn't aware that one of the wheels became loose. He managed to stop the vehicle. "The wheel of the vehicle came out, rolled forward and hit the 17-year-old learner. The visible injury indicated that either the tyre or the rim hit the learner on the right side of the head," said Covane. The incident happened at around 4.30pm on Tuesday on the N8 to Botshabelo. Paramedics declared the learner dead on the scene. The principal of Calculus School, who went to the scene, identified the teenager as one of her scholars.
