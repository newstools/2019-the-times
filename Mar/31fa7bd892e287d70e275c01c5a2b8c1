Two police officers who were shot in Johannesburg on Thursday are in a stable condition  in hospital. “The members spotted a suspected vehicle, which was circulated as having been used in a robbery, and gave chase. While approaching the corner of Main Reef and Vogt streets, the suspects began shooting at the police vehicle, which resulted in a shootout between the police officers and suspects,” police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said on Friday. One officer was shot in the shoulder and hands. The other was injured after glass from the shattered windscreen struck his head. A third police officer was unscathed. The suspects fled. National police commissioner Khehla Sitole commended the officers for attempting to “rid Johannesburg of dangerous criminals ” and added that he was pleased the officers had escaped with their lives.
