Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has called on SA women to speak out against abuse. This after a video of a man believed to be Babes Wodumo's long-time boyfriend Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo, was apparently recorded live on her Instagram account during the early hours of Monday morning.Â In the video, a man can be seen assaulting the singer several times. Maphumulo had since been arrested and was granted bail of R2,000 in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. He will appear again next month. "This incident once again highlights the extent of the scourge of gender-based violence that has gripped our country. "Sadly, these types of incidents appear to be occurring very often in the entertainment industry," Nkosi-Malobane said. She said that it was "highly important" that women take a stand and report abuse suffered at the hands of their loved ones. "The video doing the rounds on social media is a stark reminder of how a lot of women continue to lose their lives at the hands of their loved ones. "The time has come for women to break the silence against any form of abuse so that they can receive assistance. We cannot allow women to be subjected to the most degrading and inhumane behaviour perpetrated by men," she said. Malobane-Nkosi said the government would continue to support victims and survivors through their empowerment centre, Ikhaya Lethemba.
