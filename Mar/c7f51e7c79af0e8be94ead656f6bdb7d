As the family of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi prepare to bury his wife in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal, today, musician Toya Delazy has shared her heartbreak over her grandmother's death. Irene died on Monday after a long illness. She was 89. Toya, who is based in the UK, was left devastated by the news and, in a social media post addressed to her gran, said that she was struggling to cope. "Goodbye grandma I still don't believe it yet. Your spirit is larger than life, I still feel it with me," she wrote in a Facebook post. Toya said she was trying to make sense of everything, but was comforted in the knowledge that her grandmother is at rest. "I tried to pierce through my swollen chest dense with confusion, I tried to squeeze out the feelings that have been pent up in my gut for so many months. Now your beautiful spirit is soaring with the universe. You are a warrior and hero to me. "You raised me and taught me everything I know ... would you want me to go on and push forward or let it go? I am comforted by the fact that when you could feel it, I gave you my time. I can't change things now but I can honour your spirit and stand tall in the world, and not give up because it's over but press on because it happened." It is unclear whether the star will attend the funeral proceedings today and in her post she said she was conflicted over whether to come home or stay in London to perform two shows in tribute to Irene. "I either get to honour you with two shows here in London or I cancel everything and fly home and stand by you at your final resting place. Everything has just been so quick, so many decisions to make. I want to do what is best for us and I feel your spirit telling me to continue. I'm so conflicted and so far away." Irene's funeral service will be held at the Ulundi Stadium in KwaZulu-Natal.
