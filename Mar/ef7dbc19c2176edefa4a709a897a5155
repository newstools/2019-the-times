Former national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and the police’s supply-management head Ravichandran Pillay have been granted R20,000 bail each after their arrest on Friday morning. The pair appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on charges relating to emergency (blue) light procurement irregularities  amounting to more than R86m. Dressed in  blue jeans, red shirt and a black jacket, Phahlane smiled as he entered the court  on Friday morning. Phahlane and Pillay join former Gauteng police commissioner Deliwe de Lange‚ Vimpie Phineas Manthata‚ Ramahlaphi Johannes Mokwena‚ James Ramanjalum and Nombhuruza Napo, who were arrested in November in connection with procurement irregularities amounting to R80m. They face charges of fraud‚ forgery and uttering. The court granted Phahlane and Pillay bail after finding that they were not a flight risk,  had fixed addresses and were both married. “It is in the interest of justice that both accused be released,” said Magistrate Benita Oswell. She imposed a rand amount to the bail, saying it would be unfair of the court to release Pillay and Phahlane merely on warning. Phahlane’s lawyer, Piet du Plessis, earlier asked the court to release his client on warning or set bail at R10. The state did not oppose bail. Phahlane and Pillay are due back in court on March 29, when De Lange and her co-accused return to the dock.
