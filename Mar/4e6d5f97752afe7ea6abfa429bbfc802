Five suspects will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday following their arrest after police foiled a robbery at a clothing store in the Johannesburg CBD. The suspects, aged between 20 and 42, will face charges of attempted business robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele said that police had been busy with routine crime prevention duties along Eloff an Kerk streets late on Friday afternoon when they had spotted five suspicious-looking males entering a Pep store. "While busy with their observation they saw one suspect pushing a security guard inside carrying a firearm in his hand. Police cornered the suspects. One of the suspects fired several shots as he was fleeing from the scene. Five were apprehended, two unlicensed firearms with no serial number and live rounds were recovered. Police foiled the business robbery," Mbele said. "We cannot rule out the possibility that suspects may be linked to other cases of business robberies and firearms will be sent to ballistic testing to ascertain if they were not used in the commission of other crimes," Mbele added.
