One of the two councillors who were injured in an ambush which claimed the life of former ANC Youth League secretary Sindiso Magaqa said she is not surprised that a senior ANC official has been arrested in connection with the murder. Jabulile Msiya spoke to TimesLIVE shortly after the news broke that Mluleki Ndobe, Umzimkhulu District Municipality mayor and former ANC deputy secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, had been arrested on Sunday morning in connection with Magaqa’s murder. "I am not surprised that a senior comrade has been arrested, I am shocked but also relieved," she said. Ndobe was one of three ANC leaders who were barred by Magaqa’s supporters from entering the family home shortly after he died. Msiya said she was told by Magaqa’s acquaintances and former Youth League supporters who had prevented Ndobe from paying their respects to the family that "some senior politicians in the province were involved in Sindiso’s murder". Msiya, who was injured when unknown gunmen opened fire on the vehicle in which they were sitting with Magaqa, said although she had been provided with bodyguards and felt relatively safe, she would not feel "100 percent safe" until all those who were involved in Magaqa’s slaying were brought to book. "We are praying that the police try and convict whoever was responsible for this," Msiya added. Police minister Bheki Cele’s spokesperson Reneilwe Serero confirmed Ndobe’s arrest. "I can confirm that a senior official from Harry Gwala District municipality has been arrested. At this stage I can not divulge the name until their court appearance which will be in the next 48 hours,” she said. ANC secretary in KwaZulu-Natal Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party was shocked. "It's very shocking. It is a setback for the ANC." Magaqa died in September 2017 at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital from gunshot wounds after the assassination attempt two months earlier.
