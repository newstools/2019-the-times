Social media users have reacted to finance minister Tito Mboweni's calls for the SA National Roads Agency (Sanral) to reverse its decision to halt the collection of e-toll debt. The company announced on Wednesday that its board of directors had made the resolution at a meeting on Tuesday. TheÂ decision includes historic debt and summonses from 2015. Speaking at the introduction of the new commissioner of the South African Revenue Service, Edward Kieswetter, in Pretoria on Thursday, Mboweni said he was was not happy with Sanral's decision and claimed it undermined what the Treasury had said in its budget - that it supported the "user must pay" principle. "They must reverse that decision immediately or else this has implications for the bond market. It has implications for the fiscus. It has implications for their own credit rating and the credit rating for the country," Mboweni said. Mboweni said people should ensure they did not take careless decisions in the middle of a very difficult financial situation. The minister's comment drew reaction from those on social media who flooded Twitter with memes and messages mocking Mboweni and reaffirming their commitment not to pay.
