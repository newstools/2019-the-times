Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s name topped Twitter trends on Tuesday. This follows the EFF’s proposal in parliament to have Cape Town International Airport renamed after the late struggle icon. Before the debate in Cape Town on Tuesday, the EFF had long expressed its opinion on  renaming  the airport. In the hours leading to the debate, the  proposed name change dominated conversation on Twitter, with most throwing their weight behind it. So supportive were some that they even considered lending the EFF their votes come the 2019 general elections in May. The ANC shot down the motion, and reactions continued to pour in as people expressed their anger and disappointment by coining even more hashtags, such as #WinnieMandela and #WinnieMandelaInternationalAirport. The proposal was rejected by the ANC and other opposition parties, including the FF+ and the DA, The UDM and the NFP were in favour.
