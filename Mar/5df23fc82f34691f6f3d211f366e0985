Parts of South Africa will be plunged into darkness for the weekend. Eskom announced on Friday that it would implement stage 2 load-shedding until Sunday. The embattled power utility's spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said this was a result of shortage of generation capacity due to plant breakdowns, as well as the need to manage diesel and water resources. "The management of the diesel and water resources is essential to ensure that the impact of the potential stage of load-shedding in the week ahead can be reduced. "The system outlook for next week further indicates a high risk and that up to stage 2 load-shedding may be implemented until the middle of next week," Phasiwe said. Stage 2 load-shedding is likely to continue until 11pm on Friday. Eskom said it "regrets the inconvenience that this will cause". Residents and business were urged to use electricity sparingly.
