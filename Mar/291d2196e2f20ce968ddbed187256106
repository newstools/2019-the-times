Police are combing an area on the R618 between Vryheid and Nongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal where five awaiting-trial prisoners escaped on Tuesday. According to police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane, two members of the police had been transporting the prisoners in a VW Amarok double cab to the Nongoma Magistrate's Court when they were overpowered. He told TimesLIVE that the  escapees were facing charges of  murder, rape, robbery and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. â€œToday at 11am two police officers were transporting awaiting-trial prisoners from Nongoma to Vryheid correctional services. While they were passing Ngome  policing area, the two prisoners, seated in the back seat of the vehicle, overpowered the police officers and took their firearms. "The vehicle stopped and the prisoners fired shots. Three prisoners who were in the bin of the bakkie escaped along with the two who had held up the officers and took their firearms. "A case of escaping from lawful custody and robbery will be opened at Ngome police station for investigation. Police are still at the scene and they are searching for the escapees with the K9 (dog) unit." Zwane said shots were fired, but  no one was injured during the incident, despite earlier reports that a policeman was in a critical condition.
