A 16-year-old girl is presumed drowned and a 17-year-old boy was rescued by fishermen at the Blue Lagoon in Durban on Saturday afternoon. Netcare 911 said it responded to reports of a drowning at the Blue Lagoon, a well-known fishing area at the mouth of the Umgeni River. "Reports from the scene indicate a 17-year-old male and a 16-year-old female were crossing the river mouth when they were both swept under by the strong current. "Fishermen who witnessed the event managed to rescue the male patient and safely bring him back to shore," Netcare 911 said in a statement. The young man was assessed on the scene by an advanced life support paramedic and found to be in a stable condition. The female could not be located despite best efforts from a number of  rescue officials including lifeguards, the police K9 unit and various ambulance services. She has been presumed drowned and the search will continue on Sunday. The male patient was transported by ambulance to hospital for further treatment.
