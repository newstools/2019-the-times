Harry Gwala district mayor Mluleki Ndobe is a relieved but angry man. Addressing media outside the Umzimkhulu Magistrate's Court on Monday, where  a charge of murder in connection with the 2017 death of ANC Youth League general secretary  Sindiso Magaqa was provisionally withdrawn against him, Ndobe said he wouldn't go into the details of the case. Ndobe, Sbonelo Myeza, 39, Mbulelo Mpofana, 34, and Zweliphansi Skhosana, 48, were charged  after the state  alleged that they had acted with "common purpose" in having premeditated the murder of Magaqa. They also faced two counts of attempted murder. According to the charge sheet, the second and third counts related to the attempted murder of Jabulile Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafa on July 13 2017, the same day Magaqa was gunned down. However, on Monday, control prosecutor Sohana Moodley told the court that the state was provisionally withdrawing the charges against Ndobe and Skhosana. "I am not prepared to say anything about the case. I have mixed feelings. I am relieved, but at the same time I am very emotional and very angry about it. "I can be accused of anything, but definitely not murder or conspiracy to commit murder," Ndobe said. He added that he would consult his lawyers, as well as the leadership of the ANC, and would then issue a statement. Ndobe said he was grateful to the ANC national executive committee and the provincial executive committee for their support.
