Peter Nyathi, who started out as a worker on a mushroom farm, has describe two decades of blood, sweat and tears to build a thriving business that today supplies to large retailers such as Pick n Pay and Shoprite Checkers. Announced as Pick n Pay’s small supplier of the year last week, Nyathi, 53, of Tropical Mushrooms described his success story as a “very hard journey”, at one point of which he had no choice but to offer a bank shares in his company so he could secure lending.
