At least six people have been confirmed dead following floods that ravaged parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. Among the dead was a 28-year-old woman in the Verulam area - north of Durban. Police divers used drone technology to recover the body of the woman who was swept away in her car during the flash floods. A police source said the search and rescue team, helped by the fire department, resumed their search for the woman on Monday after poor light resulted in the operation being called off on Sunday. "The water had subsided slightly and with the help of a UAV drone, the vehicle was located 500m downstream with only two tyre rims protruding above the water," said the police source. The search and rescue team’s diver operation resulted in the recovery of the woman’s body from inside the submerged vehicle. "Divers had to force entry through a window to gain access as the doors were embedded in the sand." An inquest docket has been opened. Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube together with eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede visited the flood-affected areas. They also visited a family of which three members - a mother, father and a child - were washed away. The bodies of the father and a child have been recovered but the mother is still missing. In another incident, two people are still reportedly missing in Verulam. "The police search is still ongoing for all the missing persons. The scale of devastation is overwhelming," said Dube-Ncube.
