The body of a 22-year-old man was found in the early hours of Monday at a Free State school. Police spokesperson Sgt Ikobeng Hlubi said the body was found around 4am at Joe Solomon Primary School in Heidedal, Bloemfontein. The man's body was found behind a pile of bricks in the school yard. He had a stab wound to the right eye. "According to witnesses, the deceased was being chased by two males who were driving a kombi and he jumped the fence of the school," said Hlubi. A 38-year-old man was later arrested at a local hospital while getting stitches. He was charged with murder and is expected to appear in court soon.
