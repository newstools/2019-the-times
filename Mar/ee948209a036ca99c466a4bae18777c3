DJ Tira has come under fire on social media after he posted a video of himself jamming to Mampintsha's new track. The track purportedly features the words Mampintsha was heard shouting in viral video footage of him allegedly slapping Babes Wodumo earlier this month. Mampintsha was arrested on charges of assault and was released on R2,000 bail. He laid a counter charge of assault against Babes. DJ Tira topped the trends list over the weekend after he shared a short clip of himself, his wife, Gugu Khathi, and an unknown girl hyping up and promoting Mampintsha's new song. The video went viral as social media users put Tira on blast for "supporting" an alleged woman abuser. In the alleged "abuse" video, Mampintsha could be heard saying: "Kuney'ngane layindlini" [There are kids in this house].Â That exact same line can be heard on the video Tira shared. Shortly after the video of Mampintsha allegedly slapping Babes several times went viral, Tira issued a media statement, distancing himself from the situation. In an interview with Drum magazine, Tira also said Mampintsha should face the consequences of his actions. "Mampintsha is a close friend, but what he did wasn't right, and he needs to get whatever punishment is due to him," Tira said at the time. Attempts by TshisaLIVE to get comments from DJ Tira or Afrotainment and Mampintsha (through his lawyer Pat Magwaza) on the song and Tira's apparent support of it were unsuccessful at the time of publishing. Check out the videos of DJ Tira jamming to the track below. Twitter users also expressed their outrage through comments and memes.
