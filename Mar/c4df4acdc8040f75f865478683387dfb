Three schoolgirls have died and one is fighting for her life after a taxi collided with them as they were walking to school on Wednesday morning. Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said shortly after 7.15am paramedics were called to an “horrific” accident on Dumisane Makhanye Road, near the VN Naik School for the Deaf, in Newlands East. “On arrival paramedics were faced with absolute tragedy as a single taxi had collided with four teenage girls on their way to school, dragging them for some way. Unfortunately, three of the four had sustained some major injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for them and they were declared deceased at the scene.” Jamieson said the fourth girl was in a critical condition and was receiving advanced life-care treatment by paramedics. She would be transported to hospital for further care once she was stabilised. The taxi driver is currently not at the scene of the accident. This is a developing story.
