Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the party will fight the criminal record of former Pan Africanist Congress freedom fighter Kenny Motsamai in order to  be able to deploy him in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Mosamai was convicted for killing a white traffic officer in Rustenburg in 1989. Malema said Motsamai's criminal record must be expunged for it was "a political record". According to Malema, Motsamai was in the league of Nelson Mandela and other ANC political prisoners, the only difference being he shot the oppressor during the struggle. "Kenny Motsamai is a revolutionary and in a revolution you shoot to kill which is what he did. "We never expected him to give roses to the boers," (whites) said Malema. "He (Motsamai) is not a common prisoner, he is a political prisoner in the league of Nelson Mandela. "You cannot be imprisoned for being in combat with the oppressor. We wish we were there when Kenny Motsamai shot the boers so that when he shoots this side, we shoot the other side." Malema said the EFF would continue to fight for all political prisoners who were still behind bars to be freed. Motsamai served 27 years and 11 months behind bars for the 1989 murder. The officer was killed amid a bank robbery sanctioned by the PAC. The proceeds from the robbery were to assist the PAC in its activities. He was 26 years old when he was arrested and had just returned from Ethiopia after military training. He had refused to apologise or show remorse for the killing of the traffic officer. He joined the EFF in July 2018.
