A stretch of road west of Johannesburg will be closed fromÂ Monday for emergency roadworks to repair three trenches dug up by protesters, said the Gauteng department of roads and transport. The R24 Rustenburg Road near Orient Hills in Magaliesburg will be completely blocked to traffic for 24 hours as a crew repairs the damage caused during a community protest a few weeks ago. "The full road closure will affect the R24 four-way crossing at R400 Maropeng Road as well as the soft lock closure at R24 Tarlton Crossing where residents and light vehicles will be allowed access as the road surface is not suitable for heavy vehicles or trucks," the department said in a statement. Motorists are advised to use D400/N14 via Brandvlei as an alternative route and not to attempt to drive on the closed section of the road. Other alternative routes are D400/R563 Maropeng towards Oaktree and Waterval Road, which is a gravel road and suitable for light vehicles only.
