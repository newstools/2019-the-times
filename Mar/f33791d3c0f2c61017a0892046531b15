Black Leopards owner David Thidiela's appeal on Friday at the South African Football Association (Safa) against his one-year ban from football was postponed without a date. Thidiela's ban was as a result of a tirade against referee Victor Hlungwani following Leopards' 1-0 Absa Premiership defeat against Bloemfontein Celtic in Thohoyandou in September. The Premier Soccer League's (PSL) disciplinary committee banned Thidiela and slapped him with a R1-million fine in on February 5. The Leopards boss was also removed from the PSL's executive committee. "The appeal has been postponed sine die [without a date]‚" Safa's legal head Tebogo Motlanthe told TimesLIVE on Saturday. "That was because Thidiela and his legal team need to give the PSL documents‚ like the transcript‚ and they must file their heads [of argument]." Thidiela is likely to face a separate PSL disciplinary hearing for an angry letter sent in December where he launched a scathing attack on league chairman Irvin Khoza. Thidiela called for regime change and‚ in reference to Khoza‚ said the league needed “more than one man” to make decisions.
