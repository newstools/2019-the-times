A police sergeant who allegedly urged motorists to pay a bribe to avoid being fined at a vehicle check point in one of Cape Town's most affluent suburbs was arrested on a charge of corruption on Friday. The arrest was carried out after an investigation into the allegations, which were posted on social media. "This morning a 41-year-old police sergeant was arrested by members of the Western Cape anti-corruption unit when he reported for duty at the Camps Bay police station," said police spokesperson Capt FC van Wyk. On  January 29 at a vehicle check point on Victoria Road in Camps Bay the sergeant allegedly "induced motorists to pay a bribe to prevent hefty fines for minor traffic offences, like driving an unlicensed motor vehicle". The police officer was scheduled to appear in court later on Friday. "We are serious about rooting out corruption in the police and every endeavour will be made to get rid of police officers who are engaged in corrupt activities," said a statement by Van Wyk.
