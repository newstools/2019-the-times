Five wanted armed robbery suspects were arrested on the N2 in Cape Town on Friday afternoon after a high-speed chase. Police spokesperson Capt FC van Wyk said members of the national intervention unit were patrolling the highway in search of the suspects who had targeted a cigarette delivery truck. "This delivery vehicle was targeted for an armed robbery but the perpetrators' plans were uncovered when police stopped and arrested the suspects" in a Quantum. A white Mercedes-Benz sped away. Van Wyk said the unit spotted the Mercedes C180 and gave chase. Officers instructed the men to pull over on the corners of the N2 off-ramp and Borchards Quarry but had guns pointed at them. "The police members fired two shots with an R5 rifle into the rear tyres of the Mercedes and the vehicle was brought to a standstill," said Van Wyk. Five men aged between 31 and 45 were taken to Woodstock police station and charged with armed robbery, possession of firearms and pointing a firearm. They are expected to appear in court soon.
