The Moegatle 4x4 Trail is not a place for people faint of heart. Designed to challenge those who enjoy getting their tyres dirty, this off-roading paradise is packed with lots of gnarly obstacles designed to test your (and your vehicle's) mettle. One such obstacle is the fearsome "Koos se Klip": a 45-degree ascent up a slippery rockface. Yeah, let's just say that this isn't a place where you want any mechanical failures. You know, like your rear axle suddenly breaking â€“ which is exactly the fate that befell this unfortunate Suzuki Jimny driver. Amazingly, faced with  imminent death, he manages to  make the save of the century. And probably one of the most tense YouTube videos you'll see all week. Enjoy.
