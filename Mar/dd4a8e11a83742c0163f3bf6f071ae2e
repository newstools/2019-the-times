A post addressing the Danny K race issue by well-known spoof account, Coconut Kelz, has gone viral after "Kelz" cancelled the singer. Lesego Tlhabi runs the account and her alter-ego, Kelz, often addresses national talking points in SA from a white "kugel" perspective. Danny K created a stir on social media after commenting that white people need to check their privilege. While some people applauded the wealthy musician for his statements, others said it wasn't exactly groundbreaking. "Kelz" took to Twitter to "cancel" Danny for his comments, saying that he might as well "change your name to Danny K-word." Watch the video below: Here's what started the frenzy.
