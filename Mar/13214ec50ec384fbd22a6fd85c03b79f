An elderly woman ploughed her Mercedes-Benz into her home in Verulam, north of Durban, on Tuesday after experiencing a dizzy spell. The woman, 68, and her passenger had to be freed from the wreckage by firefighters. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA said the incident occurred in Verulam's busy Wick Street area, near the local metro police station. "At 12.37pm, members of Reaction Unit SA were called out to the scene by someone who heard the crash. When they arrived, firefighters from the eThekwini fire and emergency services were in the process of removing the trapped women. With the use of pneumatic tools, the passenger door was opened and one of the woman was freed." Balram said the driver suffered head and spinal injuries. "She was extricated from the vehicle by medics and firemen before being transported to Umhlanga Hospital. "According to the driver, she was approaching her home when she felt dizzy and weak. Instead of turning into her driveway she suddenly accelerated towards her home. The vehicle ploughed through a wooden barrier before it crashed into the home, which is a few metres below road level," said Balram. The passenger was unharmed.
