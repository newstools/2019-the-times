As social media users from across Mzansi went to war over racism and white privilege, in the wake of Danny K's comments on the topic this week, Scoop has weighed in on the debate. Danny K sparked debate recently when he posted a video and several comments about white people and race, claiming that "not enough white people call out racism when it rears it ugly head" and encouraging his white followers to "stand firm and have courage". "We can no longer be silent," said the singer. His comments sparked fierce debate on social media and soon celebs from across the country were rushing to defend or criticise Danny. Danny's comments came at a time when social media users were trying to dissect reports that some of the country's leading banks were charging their black customers more than white customers. Scoop weighed in on the wider debate of white privilege, claiming it was "futile" to look to white people to reinforce black people's claims on racism and discrimination. "Asking and expecting white people to acknowledge their privilege is futile and further demonstrates how black folks after all these years are still looking for a white person to solidify the blacks claims on racism and discrimination." While he applauded Danny's comments, he said it was in the hands of black people to make a change. "Black people must come up with their own diagnosis, their own findings and conclusions and act according to their survival. I love Danny K, I appreciate that tweet, but it ain't gonna do sh*t for us."
