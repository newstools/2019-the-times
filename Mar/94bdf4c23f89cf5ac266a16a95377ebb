Family, friends and fans of Matwetwe actor Sibusiso Khwinana gathered at the AFM Hilltop Restoration Centre in Soshanguve on Thursday to pay tribute to the star. Khwinana was killed in Pretoria on Friday during an altercation over his cellphone. He was stabbed in the upper abdomen. Gauteng premier David Makhura visited the Khwinana family home earlier on Thursday and said three suspects had been identified. A police task team had been set up to catch those suspected of being responsible for the actor’s death. In an impromptu press conference with Makhura on Thursday morning, one family member urged those involved in the crime to come forward so “we can get closure and carry on”. It was a day filled with song, dance and tears as those close to the young actor spoke about how he lived his life with passion, determination and focus to achieve his dreams. Matwetwe, which was directed by Kagiso Lediga and produced by DJ Black Coffee, released in cinemas across the country on January 25. One of Khwinana's childhood friends spoke fondly about how they would spend hours listening to Black Coffee's music, not knowing that the rising star would one day work with him. Lediga paid glowing tribute to Khwinana's work ethic and drive. "Sibusiso Khwinana was the best in the world and if he was given the chance, forget the Saftas, we would have seen him at the Oscars and at the Emmys." Lediga said he's happy that he got to meet Khwinana and was part of his dream coming together somehow. As several friends shared fond memories of Khwinana, it was all too much for his family who were overcome with grief. Khwinana will be laid to rest on March 9 after a funeral service at AFM Hilltop Restoration Centre in Soshanguve. Here's some of the emotional moments from the memorial service:
