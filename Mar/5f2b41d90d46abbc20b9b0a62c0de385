KwaZulu-Natal police have taken Newcastle mayor Ntuthuko Mhlaba into custody on Friday, reportedly in connection with a political killing in the province. "At this point, we cannot confirm what the mayor has been picked up for or whether he has been charged," ANC KZN spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu told TimesLIVE on Friday. Mhlaba, who is a medical doctor, was sworn in as mayor last month. Simelane-Zulu said the ANC provincial leaders would be meeting to discuss the matter and gather more information about the arrest. Media reports which TimesLIVE could not immediately verify said the arrest was in connection with the 2017 murder of former ANC Youth League official Wandile Ngobeni. Police minister Bheki Cele's spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, confirmed an arrest but would not provide further details. "I can confirm one senior official from the Newcastle municipality has been arrested. I cannot divulge the name of him/her at this stage. The suspect will appear in court in the next 48 hours," Serero said. The detention comes just days after Harry Gwala district mayor Mluleki Ndobe was arrested on Sunday in connection with  the 2017 murder of ANC Youth League leader Sindiso Magaqa.
