Trevor Noah has fans rolling with laughter when he featured a news story about wire from the US/Mexico border going missing. In a snippet on The Daily Show, Trevor could not contain his laughter when he featured a news story about how US officials found the wire being used to build fences at nearby homes but no one would confess to where they got the material from. Trevor poked fun at how US President probably would have reacted when he saw the story on the news. It's hilarious!
