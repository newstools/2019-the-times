While Mzansi may be sleeping on A-Reece, he's definitely making waves overseas and when Sway Calloway sent a message to the young rapper on Twitter, Mzansi woke up to the fact. Even those that won't admit it know that they would love to be a guest on Sway in the Morning, one of the most revered shows in the global hip-hop fraternity. So while DJ PH was in the States, Sway jumped onto his social media to send a message to one rapper he's been keen on talking to. Twitter was stoked when he called out A-Reece. "I wanna sayÂ Calloway to invite South African MCs to come on Sway in the Morning, who's gon be the first? A-Reece! A-Reece man hit me back man, I need a number on you, let's make that happen," Sway said. There's no denying that A-Reece is a great artist and in Mzansi he's loved even more for his resilient spirit. After having left Ambitious Ent. many weren't sure if the Paradise rapper would get up again but he's proved over and over that "you can't keep a good man down". Twitter went into full celebration mode and started planning how they could help get A-Reece on the show. As an independent artist, his fans figured, he could use all the sponsorship available. Cassper, AKA, Nasty C and Stogie T have already been on the show to rep Mzansi. But Twitter has no doubt that A-Reece would be a solid representative of SA hip-hop. We are rooting for you Reece!
