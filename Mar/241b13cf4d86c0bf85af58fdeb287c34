A female warder at the Goedemoed prison in the Eastern Cape was killed on Friday after she and a colleague were held hostage by inmates. While details were still emerging, both the Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services (JICS) and the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) confirmed the incident. According to Popcru’s spokesman, Richard Mamabolo, a second female warder was raped. Goedemoed prison is situated in Aliwal North. "One female official has been fatally wounded, while the other has been raped by an inmate. Our Popcru provincial secretary is visiting the institution and further details will follow," said Mamabolo on Friday night. The JCIS’s inspecting judge, Justice Johann van der Westhuizen, said: "That DCS [department of correctional services] officials work under dangerous and stressful situations and asks them to continue to be vigilant whilst performing their duties." The JICS said it would continue monitoring the situation at the Goedemoed prison.
