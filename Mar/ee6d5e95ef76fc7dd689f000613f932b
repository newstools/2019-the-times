Popular e-hailing service Taxify, now known as Bolt, has announced that it will launch a food-delivery service in South Africa. My Broadband reported that South Africa will be one of three countries to  have the  service, which will be launched in the next few months. The other countries are  Finland and Estonia. Uber Eats is active in South Africa but the app is not available in other parts of the continent or in  Eastern Europe. Taxify saw this as an opportunity to explore those markets, Bloomberg reported. Taxify recently changed its name to Bolt, after five years in operation. The company has also expanded its reach in South Africa, with its services now available in East London and Polokwane. But many on social media did not seem too optimistic about  food-service delivery from the company.
