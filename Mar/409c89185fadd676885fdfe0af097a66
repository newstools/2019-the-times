U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has since turned against him and pleaded guilty to multiple crimes, had asked him directly for a pardon but was rejected. "Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied!," Trump tweeted. "Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO."
