Welcome Msomi, a trustee of the Living Legends Legacy Programme (LLLP), appeared in court on Monday charged with theft of R8m. Msomi was arrested at the weekend in Durban by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit following a probe into R8m that was allegedly stolen from the LLLP Trust account earlier this year. He appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Monday and was remanded in custody. He is due back in court on April 2. "The programme [LLLP] was started by the department of arts and culture in September 2018, and a trust was set up in order to empower living legends when it comes to accessing opportunities available to them," said Lloyd Ramovha, spokesperson for the Hawks. According to his website, Msomi is a playwright, producer and director. He is the founder of the Izulu Dance Theatre which was established in 1965. "In 1979, Msomi established the extension of the Theatre in New York City," reads the website.
