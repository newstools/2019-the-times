Two 10-year-old boys from the Montshiwa location near Mahikeng have allegedly been kidnapped, North West police said on Thursday. The pair was allegedly abducted on Tuesday as they played in a park, said Sergeant Lesedi Dingoko. “It is alleged that Onalenna Molehabangwe and Gontse Cholo were kidnapped by three occupants driving a Volkswagen Polo,” said Dingoko. “According to information available at this stage, reports suggest that the victims, who are both from extension 38, were in the company of another boy when the suspects lured the victims to their car with chips. The suspects then allegedly grabbed and put the boys inside the boot of the vehicle and drove off with them. The children were never seen since then.” Dingoko told TimesLIVE that an intense police search was  under way. The “kidnappers” had not made any contact with police or the victims’ relatives. The motive for the alleged abduction is unknown. “Onalenna was wearing a blue, long-sleeve T-shirt and a blue denim, while Gontse was wearing a short-sleeve T-shirt with red, yellow and blue stripes,” said Dingoko. Both children are pupils  at Podile Primary School in Ramosadi village.
