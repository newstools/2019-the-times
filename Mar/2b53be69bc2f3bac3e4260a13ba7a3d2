In real life, Ntando Duma will go all Bruce Lee on you for cyberbullying her daughter on these social media streets and she made an example of a guy who did exactly this last week. Ntando and Junior De Rocka share a one-year-old daughter and both of them made sure that tweeps knew they would never tolerate cyberbullying of their bundle of joy. Earlier this week Junior slammed a cyberbully, who said his daughter is "not cute" but Ntando found a different way to deal with the bully. Real-life confrontation! She took to her Twitter page to share a short story of how her encounter with the tweep that bullied her baby went down when she "bumped" into him. Ntando said she was sick and tired of cyber bullies who pretended to be fans in real life. She said this particular person, said "I'm a fan of your work" when she asked him to repeat the filth he had said about her daughter. "Y'all are actually uncouth for thinking cyberbullying, dragging and trash talking innocent people is cool. Next time I 'bump' into another one of you 'social media heroes' Ngizok'trapa unhanjelwe inqonqo! Try me and good luck," Ntando issued a warning shot. If you know you can't bring it, then walk in the opposite direction when you see Ntando before you get you some a** whooping!
