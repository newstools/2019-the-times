Actor Tiisetso Thoka says society's definition of a man needs a real reality check and he wants to teach fans that a metrosexual man is a man by all counts through his new role on Rhythm City. The actor told TshisaLIVE that too often there is a perception that a man with a "feminine" side is gay. He said his character on the show is going to flip the switch on people who believed that. "People have long since confused what it meant when a man says he has a feminine side. For me, people have always assumed that I'm that 'hardcore' kind of person, and stuff like that, but that's not the case. I'm a simple guy, who is kind of soft, and sometimes (people) tend to think because of that softness that I am gay or something. And I am not gay. I have nothing against them. But they make that deduction based on how I look." Tiisetso said it is important for people, particularly young boys, to know that a man doesn't have to be a "certain way". He said a man who is meticulous about his grooming and appearance is no less of a man. "I think one of the biggest problems is the world we live in has made it seem as if a man has one particular look. But men need to be who they are truly and live life defining who they are." After slaying all his other roles on productions such as The Herd, Isithembiso, Gold Diggers and many others, Tiisetso said he is looking forward to the unique complexity his character brings. Especially in terms of falling in love and tackling the "man candy" label he's sure to be given. His character, Siya, comes into Mampho's life when she is looking for a temporary housemate while her buddy, Rene, is away performing in a musical on Broadway. The guy, who is heavily invested in looking good, spends half his time half-naked. "I don't know if I can call myself 'eye candy', but those that will see the character will see that he definitely subscribes to that stereotype. There will definitely be a lot of sexy, semi-nude scenes in there" Ooh la la la!
