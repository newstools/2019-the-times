ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula appeared before the Zondo inquiry into state capture on Friday to give evidence on his connection with the Gupta brothers. However, all many on social media wanted to know was what was going on with the politician's hair. Mbaks told the commission that the looting of state resources was "against the purpose of why people vote us into power". He also spoke of getting a call from Ajay Gupta, who told him he would be appointed minister of sport and recreation, before the appointment was made official by then president Jacob Zuma. "The matter of the perception or reality out there that resources of the state are basically being looted or redirected to individuals because of their proximity to those who are in power and they use that as an advantage ... it is politically incorrect," said Mbalula. While social media was filled with reaction to his testimony, Twitter timelines were also filled with comments about his "long and unkempt" hair and choice of eye-wear.
