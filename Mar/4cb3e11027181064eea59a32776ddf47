Two men accused of extorting money from a Cape Town businessman were released on R10,000 bail each in the Atlantis Magistrate's Court on Monday. The men allegedly assaulted the businessman while they were collecting debt on behalf of a third party. Because they are facing extortion charges, the men cannot be named until they plead before the court. The lawyer of one of the accused, William Booth, made several allegations against the investigating officer in the matter, including that the cop was being investigated for alleged corruption. The state pointed out that the policeman had never been charged, nor had he been to court over the allegations. At first, the state opposed bail - claiming that the witnesses in the case would be intimidated. The state said that the complainant, an elderly man, was assaulted several times by the two accused in an attempt to collect the money. One of the men is a bouncer boss and the other is a private investigator who is currently also doing private investigation work for Eskom. The men may not visit the jurisdiction of Atlantis, north of Cape Town, including Melkbosstrand, but the court ruled that they may travel through the jurisdiction if they notify the state, through their legal representatives, 48 hours before doing so. The men may also leave South Africa given that they inform the investigating officers of their departure 48 hours before leaving. Booth attended court with four armed private security guards. The matter was postponed until May 15.
