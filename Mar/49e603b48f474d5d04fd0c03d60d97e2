After his lies about Touch My Blood being his last album, AKA knows that he has to give the megacy some amazing music, and by the looks of things, he is already neck-deep into accomplishing that mission. AKA has been hinting at the kind of collabos fans should expect on his upcoming album nearly causing a stampede of excitement. While nothing is confirmed yet, the rapper has already hinted at having major names like Sjava, Rouge and Gemini Major on the project. This week he also served a little tea on cooking something up with Youngsta CPT and A-Reece, fam! And who can forget about that secret location meeting that AKA had with some of the very best in the industry. Meanwhile, AKA is also preparing for his much-awaited concert AKA Orchestra on The Square later this month. Mans is booked and he's busy!
