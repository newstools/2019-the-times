Ayanda Thabethe did the things by buying her mom a new car for her 60th birthday. The TV personality said she wants her mom to know how grateful she is for all the sacrifices she's made. "She sacrificed so much for my sisters and I, she deserves the world! Happy 60th mom. I thank God for giving me this privilege to buy you flowers while you can still smell them and tell you just how much I am grateful for putting my life ahead of your own!" Sweet.
