Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has taken his campaign to rename Cape Town International Airport after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to parliament. Malema has tabled a draft motion calling for the airport's name to be changed to that of Madikizela-Mandela. The draft motion is due to be debated in the national assembly at 2pm on Tuesday. Malema's draft motion  states that the EFF "believes that the greatest honour to give Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will be to rename the Cape Town International Airport after the struggle icon in order to ensure that memories of her gallant war against apartheid are not deleted". Madikizela-Mandela, a former ANC MP and outspoken anti-apartheid activist, as well as former wife of statesman Nelson Mandela, died  in April 2018. The EFF immediately started a campaign for the Cape Town airport to be named after her. Other names being considered by authorities include those of late Pan Africanist Congress leader Robert Sobukwe, ANC stalwart Albertina Sisulu, and Krotoa, who was a Khoisan translator who worked for the Dutch during the Cape colony era. The Airports Company of South Africa last year called for public comments on the renaming of three other airports, Kimberley, East London and Port Elizabeth.
