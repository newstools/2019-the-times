People on Twitter have weighed in on what they believe they would do if they found themselves in Babes' situation. This follows a viral video that was posted on her Instagram account on Monday morning, which purportedly shows Babes being physically abused, allegedly by Mampintsha, who is her long-time boyfriend. Tweeps have different theories of what they would do, with some saying they would report to immediate family and police while others say they would simply leave. Here are some of the reactions: This is not the first time claims of abuse have surfaced against Mampintsha. In 2018, Babes confirmed in a Metro FM interview that she had suffered violence at the hands of Mampintsha, but did not open a case with the police. Mampintsha posted a video in which he denied abusing Babes and said the two experienced problems like other couples do.
