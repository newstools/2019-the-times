An EFF MP on trial for allegedly stealing a laptop from the Western Cape legislature says he is ready to reboot his reputation. Nazier Paulsen appeared in the regional court in Cape Town on Monday. Paulsen, who has had the theft allegations hovering over his head for about two years, described the case as "a David versus Goliath" scenario. According to Paulsen, his woes started in 2015 when his party promoted him from being a member of the provincial legislature to the national assembly. The MP told TimesLIVE that he wrote to the speaker of the legislature, Sharna Fernandez, and expressed his intention to buy the laptop, which he had been using for some time. However, he said he received no response. He said he was surprised when he received a call from a journalist asking him if was aware that he had been reported to the police for the theft of the laptop. He said he had since turned it in after "deleting his personal stuff". The matter was postponed to May 16 for further investigation. But Paulsen said he wanted the case to be heard before the upcoming general elections. "I wanted the DA to taste defeat," said Paulsen. "I returned the laptop.‚Äù He said he intended to subpoena Fernandez, the DA chief whip in the legislature, Mark Wiley, and Cape Town mayor Dan Plato, who is also the former community safety MEC. Paulsen said the case was politically motivated. "I wrote to the speaker [Fernandez] to ask her if I could purchase the laptop because it had personal information and other confidential information. I thought it would be easier. Who wants a second-hand laptop? It is like giving second-hand underwear to someone," said Paulsen. He said he had other exchanges via e-mail, but couldn't share them as they were "part of my defence".
