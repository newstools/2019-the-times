Johannesburg residents who use prepaid electricity will not be able to buy vouchers on Tuesday night due to maintenance, City Power has announced. The maintenance will last for two hours. “City Power regrets to inform customers that they will be unable to purchase electricity vouchers between 9pm and 11pm [on Tuesday] evening due to maintenance on internet systems,” City Power wrote on its Twitter page on Tuesday afternoon. The notice comes as power utility Eskom implemented stage 4 load-shedding from 9am on Tuesday. It was set to continue until 11pm. Stage 4 calls for 4,000MW to be rotationally load-shed nationally at a given period. "We remind customers that load-shedding at stage 4 is no cause for alarm as the system is being effectively controlled. Load-shedding is a highly-controlled process implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout," said the parastatal. "During stage 4 load-shedding, approximately 80% of the country’s demand is still being met."
