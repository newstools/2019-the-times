One of the Moses Mabhida Stadium soccer hooligans - who repeatedly kicked a security guard during a pitch invasion - has been sentenced to three years in prison. Kwezilomo Madiba appeared in the Durban Regional Court on Thursday. He was arrested along with Siphosenkosi Knowledge Memela, John Sibongiseni Khumalo, Cebolendoda Hadebe, Douglas Mhlaliseni Mkhize, Nolwethu Cokotha, Zibongile Njova, Sihle Duncan Zungu, and Dennis Thusi after they invaded the Moses Mabhida Stadium pitch and caused havoc after a match between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars in April last year. Madiba received three years while his eight co-accused all received three-year terms which were suspended for five years on condition that they are not convicted of the same crime during that time. Madiba was caught on camera assaulting the security guard and was the only one to receive jail time because he had been previously convicted of public violence in 2013 and was ordered to pay a fine or face four months in prison. The others were sentenced to 12 months of correctional supervision, subject to conditions of house arrest, as well as 16 hours of community service a month and were ordered to attend anger management programmes. Initially, 11 men were arrested on charges of public violence after invading the pitch and causing damage to the tune of R2.6m. During the pre-sentencing in March, Moses Mabhida general manager Vusi Mazibuko told the court that Durban ratepayers had to foot the bill for the repairs.
