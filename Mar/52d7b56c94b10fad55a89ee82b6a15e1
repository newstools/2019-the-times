EFF leader Julius Malema is off the hate speech hook for a series of “offensive” remarks against white and Indian people, but another firebrand politician, the BLF’s Andile Mngxitama, will have to answer in court for threatening to kill white people. The SA Human Rights Commission said on Wednesday Malema’s utterances were “problematic” but did not amount to hate speech.
