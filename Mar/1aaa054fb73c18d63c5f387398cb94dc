The Democratic Alliance said the power cuts implemented by Eskom have reached crisis levels. DA leader Mmusi Maimane addressed the media on his party's plan to keep the lights on amid constant blackouts by power utility Eskom. Maimane touched on the effects that load-shedding has had on businesses as well as public hospitals. Here is his address in five telling quotes: Rahima Moosa hospital "On Friday, I went to Rahima Moosa hospital, where in the event of load-shedding, if the generator fails, it means that they have only 30 minutes of power. Now, that might not mean anything to you, but you tell that to a person who is undergoing surgery, that they only got 30 minutes. That's not a good thing." Load-shedding a norm in townships "I was in Ngwate, you speak to people there for whom load-shedding is a common occurrence. They spend days in absolute darkness." On writing to national assembly speaker Baleka Mbete "I have written to Baleka Mbete, to say even though parliament has risen, we must reconvene to establish an ad hoc committee consisting of the portfolio committees on energy public enterprise, and trade and industry." Points of discussion during the meeting with Deputy President DD Mabuza "We must privatise Eskom's generation entities, so as to diversify what energy enters the grid, while increasing competition and lowering the costs. Second, we must instruct Eskom to freeze the last two units of Kusile's build immediately, and rather look to the entrance of power producers." National day of action "We will be gathering together, on Friday, across the country. I will be here in Gauteng, and I am calling on the people of South Africa to gather together to make their voices heard in the crisis that is before them, because ultimately this will require all of us - as the people of this country - to stand together."
