A 33-year-old taxi driver, who fled the scene of a deadly crash on Wednesday, was arrested at the KwaMashu police station in Durban. The man was the driver of a minibus taxi that ploughed into four schoolgirls in Newlands East on Wednesday morning. "A 33-year-old driver has been arrested for three counts of culpable homicide at KwaMashu police station. He will appear soon in the Ntuzuma magistrate's court," said Lt-Col Thulani Zwane. The four girls were on their way to Newlands East Secondary School when the taxi driver allegedly shot a red robot and ploughed into them. The vehicle dragged the girls for several metres before it came to a stop. The driver then fled. Three of the girls died on the scene, while the fourth girl was rushed to hospital. She is in a critical condition.
