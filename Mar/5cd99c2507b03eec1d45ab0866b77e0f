Two men contracted to the city of Johannesburg have been given a two-year jail term - or a R20,000 fine each - after pleading guilty to soliciting a bribe. They made the plea in the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Monday. They are now facing a similar but separate charge for allegedly soliciting a bribe of R6,500 from a resident of Wilro Park, west of Johannesburg, on February 19. Hamilton Seroke and Mangaliso Ngobeni were employed by Mbawula Technical Services and contracted to City Power to conduct electricity disconnection services. In the matter now before the court, it is alleged that they approached a Wilro Park resident and introduced themselves as city officials. They told him his electricity meter belonged to another house in Ruimsig and that it was supposed to be a three-phase meter, and not the meter he had. They then threatened to disconnect the man's electricity supply if he did not pay them R6,500. "The resident agreed to pay the money to the officials, but requested them to come laterÂ  to collect the cash," said City Power spokesperson  on Monday. "The resident then informed the city's group forensic and investigation services team, which set up a sting operation with police." The suspects returned to the house in Wilro Park later on February 19 to collect the cash, but police were there to arrest them. "City Power welcomes the sentence, which will serve as a reminder that people should avoid soliciting bribes using city entities' names," said the spokesperson.
