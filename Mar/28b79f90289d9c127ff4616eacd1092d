Eskom continues to be the focus of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture as it resumes on Friday. Gert Opperman, a contract manager at Eskom’s primary energy division, is set to testify. This week, the commission heard how senior officials were “fooling the system” when a R659m prepayment was issued to the Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration and Resources in 2016. According to Snehal Nagar, who oversees the financials in the utility’s primary energy division, his team was given about an hour-and-a-half to push through a controversial half-a-billion-rand payment to the Guptas on April 13 2016. Eskom’s corporate funding specialist, Sincedile Shweni, also described how the state utility flouted its own processes when it accepted a  $2bn loan agreement from Chinese-based business Huarong Energy Africa. On Thursday, the National Energy Regulator of SA announced that South Africans will pay 9.41% more for electricity in 2019/20.
