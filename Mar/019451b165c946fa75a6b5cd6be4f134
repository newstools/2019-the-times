If you have a problem with Lerato Kganyago's potential makoti skills, you might want to take a seat near the door because sis doesn't care for your opinions. The clapback queen of Mzansi has never been scared to let a hater know that they are out of line and was in fine form again when a troll came knocking on her social media page recently. It all started when Lerato posted a video of herself sweeping with a broom in high heels and a little black dress. A follower responded to the video by saying they would only take her seriously if she ditched the heels and played the part of a makoti like they wanted. Lerato was in no mood for people's opinions about her and told the follower where their lane was.
