Former director of minerals and energy Dr Thibedi Ramontja is due to  testify at the state capture inquiry on Thursday. Business rescue practitioner Piers Marsden told the Zondo commission on Wednesday how Eskom refused to renegotiate its coal supply agreement with Glencore's Optimum mine, with then Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe apparently placing no urgency on resolving issues between the power utility and the mine. This came at a time when Glencore placed its entities, Optimum Coal Mine and Optimum Coal Holdings, into business rescue, bringing the coal supply between the mine and Hendrina power station to a grinding halt in 2015. Meanwhile, lawyers representing public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan at the state capture inquiry have argued that time and money should not be wasted on "consoling" axed SA Revenue Service (Sars) boss Tom Moyane's feelings by allowing him to cross-examine the minister. In a legal to-and-fro between Moyane and Gordhan at the inquiry on Wednesday, Gordhan's lawyer, Michelle le Roux, argued that issues canvassed in Moyane's application to cross-examine her client had already been dealt with by retired judge Robert Nugent in his investigation into tax and governance issues at the revenue collector. Moyane's lawyer, Dali Mpofu, meanwhile, spoke of Gordhan's role in establishing the controversial high-risk investigations unit, dubbed the "rogue unit", which Nugent found to be a legal body.Â Mpofu also alleged that Gordhan was racist towards Moyane and referred to a phone call in which Gordhan allegedly told Moyane to "grow up". Mpofu argued that this amounted to racism, because it implied that Moyane was a "boy". Zondo will give his judgment on the matter in due course.
