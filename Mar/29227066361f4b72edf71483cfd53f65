The Allandale substation in Midrand was shut down again on Thursday after briefly coming back online after a fire that broke out on Wednesday was extinguished. "[The] Allendale substation, the scene of a fire yesterday (Wednesday), is again under total shutdown following an oil leak scare on the other transformer connected to replace the burnt-out one," City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said. "According to Eskom, the new transformer experienced some problems earlier today. Suspicion is that it was affected by yesterdayâ€™s fire." Mangena said the shutdown was a precautionary measure to avoid a "possible disaster". "Eskom technicians are currently working in it and doing tests." It is affecting Tembisa and parts of Midrand. "We do not have time of return currently but we will communicate as and when information becomes available from Eskom" Mangena said.
