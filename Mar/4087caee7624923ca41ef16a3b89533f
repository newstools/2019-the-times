Former YoTV presenter Lumko Johnson took to social media to express his disappointment and disgust towards family members that "tolerate" other family members who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. The presenter, whose Twitter thread was prompted by Loyiso Bala's viral birthday message to his younger and openly gay brother Phelo Bala, said the way he saw it, almost all members of the LGBTQ+ had a family member "like Loyiso". "We're so used to family members like Loyiso. So used to being 'tolerated'. We're so used to tolerating, because "it's not that bad". So used to the "it's not my place to judge". So used to the conditional acceptance, perpetual disapproval because my life goes against your values," he started. Lumko explained that most gay people had no choice but to accept and live with "conditional acceptance" because they were subjected to this treatment by people they loved. He added that religion, culture, traditions were among the many other elements that enforced this behaviour. Lumko encouraged other people in the LGBTQ+ community to stop accepting this behaviour. "We're so used to accommodating them, apologising for embarrassing them, letting them down and not being the sons and brothers they hoped we would be," Lumko wrote.
