An internal ANC poll says the party is likely to attract an increased number of white voters in Gauteng at the May 8 elections. According to the survey, white voter support for the ANC is at 8%, the highest it’s ever been. Gauteng premier and party provincial chairperson David Makhura attributed the growth among white supporters to president Cyril Ramaphosa’s popularity. “We have never had [such high support among white voters], even during the Mandela years,” said Makhura. The poll also says 23% of whites in polled in Gauteng were considering voting for the party. The survey targeted over 3,000 Gauteng residents between November and December last year. It places ANC’s support in the province at over 50% just a few months ahead of what is expected to be a hotly contested battle to govern the province. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
