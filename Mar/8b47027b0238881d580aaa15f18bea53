Loyiso Gola is super proud of his mom who will be graduating with an Honours degree in April after quitting her job to go back to university. Taking to Instagram, Loyiso told followers how his mom graduated with a degree two years ago and then went back last year to finish her honours. "Two years ago I posted a pic of my mom who quit her job of 26 years to go back to university and graduated at age 58. Last year she studied further and attained her honors. The graduation ceremony is 9 April in Cape Town, unfortunately I wonâ€™t make it because I will be performing in New York from 10-24 April." To make up for not being able to attend the official ceremony, Loyiso made a trip home so his mom could wear her graduation gown and they could have a mini celebration. "I am proud of her. She plans to study further."
