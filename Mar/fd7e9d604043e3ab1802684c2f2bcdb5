A motorist who was shot in the face in broad daylight in Fourways, Johannesburg, has undergone two operations and remains sedated on machine-assisted support. Samantha Wade was shot on the corner of Cedar Road and Cedar Avenue West while driving a silver convertible Mercedes Benz on March 19. The shooter, a businessman, fled in a white Range Rover and committed suicide a few kilometres away. "The family, hospital and friends have been inundated with calls enquiring as to the condition of Samantha," a family spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday. "We would like to thank you all for your prayers, thoughts and well wishes. Not a day goes by where we don't share these with Sam, who we believe is able to hear us whilst heavily sedated." The type of ammunition used in the shooting had caused severe trauma. “Sam had her first four-hour operation on the day of the shooting to remove one bullet and stabilise her while they assessed the severity of her injuries. "On Wednesday night, March 20, Sam had a 10-hour operation with the primary aim of beginning the reconstruction of her airways, tongue, upper and lower jaw. She pulled through the surgery and remains sedated and connected to machine-assisted support.” It was too early to tell what the long-term prognosis would be or if she would be able, in the future, to function without assistance. Police spokesperson Cpt Mavela Masondo said earlier that the woman was approached by a man and shot twice in the upper body.
