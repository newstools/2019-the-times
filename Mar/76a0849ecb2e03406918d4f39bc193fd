Port Elizabeth High Court judge Mandela Makaula, who has been presiding over controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso's trial, is on Friday expected to give reasons for his decision to recuse himself. This after it emerged that during the trial, certain state witnesses had allegedly been staying at a guesthouse said to be owned by Makaula. In a statement issued last month by Omotoso’s defence attorney, Peter Daubermann,  Makaula was said to have met with Daubermann and state prosecutor, advocate Nceba Ntelwa. According to the statement,  Makaula decided to recuse himself after Ntelwa had indicated that certain witnesses, whom he did not name, had stayed at the guesthouse owned by Makaula, “through a company”. Omotoso, 60, and his co-accused, Zukiswa Sitho, 28, and Lusanda Sulani, 36, face  of 97 charges ranging from rape to human trafficking. Only one state witness, Cheryl Zondi, has testified in the matter since the trial began in October 2018. HeraldLIVE
