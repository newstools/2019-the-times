Prince Kaybee was ripped to shreds by social media followers after he revealed he had "abandoned" a mini-vacation with his mom to take care of business and that in his books "family can wait". The Fetch Your Life hitmaker tweeted that he had received great news on the first day of his vacation with his mother and immediately packed up to leave. "Took my mom for a mini vac in Durban last week for 7 days, we got there first day and I got a call to do a remix and Fetch Your Life has been approved to be part of the biggest compilation in the world (will share news later). Moral of the story? For me, family can wait." Prince Kaybee made it known that on that particular day, his priority was the music. Tweeps dragged Prince Kaybee and claimed that his "attention-seeking" tendencies crossing the line. Many told him that while he'll always have a chance to make music, his mother would not always be around. They dragged him for days. But meanwhile, Kaybee wasn't even touched by the dragging. LOL! He was too busy summoning his genius!
