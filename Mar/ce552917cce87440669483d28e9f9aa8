A woman was killed and 16 people were  injured on Friday when a bus and a truck collided on the  R81 between Polokwane and Tzaneen in Limpopo, paramedics said. ER24's crew arrived on the scene at 10.30am. "A large truck was found lying on its side in one lane. Hundreds of alcohol bottles that had been on the back of the truck wereÂ  spread across the scene," said the service's spokesperson, Russel Meiring. "The second vehicle, a bus, was found a short distance away, also lying on its side. Paramedics discovered the body of a woman lying outside the bus. Unfortunately, she had already succumbed to her injuries and nothing could be done for her." Sixteen other patients were attended to on the scene, he said, with injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Meiring added: "The details surrounding this incident are not yet known, but local authorities were on the scene." The Limpopo transport department has advised motorists to use alternative routes as the accident could take hours to clear.
