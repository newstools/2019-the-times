Friday night’s deluge of rain has led to the City of Tshwane having to close the Olievenhoutbosch clinic, south of Centurion, due to flooding. City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said on Saturday that cleaning and removal of mud and water was currently under way. Members of the community in need of care were advised to visit the Laudium Community Health Centre in the interim. “It is hoped that the clinic will be operational again on Monday. “The City apologises for the inconvenience caused and remains committed to rendering quality health service to our communities,” Mashigo said.
