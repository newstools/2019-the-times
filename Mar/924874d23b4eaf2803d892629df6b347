Green denotes that the bottle containing the product is manufactured using sustainable sources. It does not refer to the product inside the packaging. Eco-friendly simply means that the packaging does not harm the planet;Â  it is biodegradable. Sustainable means that the product was made using eco-friendly practices that can be sustained for the future. The term "clean" means that the ingredients may not be eco-friendly or sustainable but are safe to use. Natural emphasises the purity of the ingredients; the product should not contain synthetic chemicals. Organic is defined as being free from any synthetic chemicals that may be harmful to the environment and to people. Being conscious is really a lifestyle term as it describes a way of thinking rather than a specific product. If you are conscious, you have a high regard for health, spirituality, wellness and the environment. Thoughtfulness is being considerate of the needs of others; being well-informed and embracing the lifestyle of less is more. Thoughtfulness is not just about responsible shopping, it is about being ethically conscious.
