DA leader Mmusi Maimane has been dominating Twitter trends after a video of him saying 44 out of 10 South Africans are without jobs went viral. Thanks to the superpowers of Woolworths water, Maimane was able to correct himself and has since made things right by tweeps who were confused by his initial statement. Maimane took to the platform to post a lighthearted video.  As he took a sip of Woolworths water, he said, in fact, 40% of South Africa's households  do not have a single source of income. Maimane made the initial mistake on Tuesday during interaction with the  Tembisa community.
