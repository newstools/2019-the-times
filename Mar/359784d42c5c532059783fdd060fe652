Power utility Eskom said it would implement stage 4 load-shedding on Tuesday. On Monday evening, Eskom said it would continue implementing stage 4 rotational power cuts, which started at 9am and were set to continue until 11pm. This would then be downgraded to stage 2 from 11pm until 9am on Tuesday. But it will then be upgraded again. "Stage 4 load shedding will be implemented on Tuesday from 9am to 11pm. This is due to a shortage of capacity," Eskom said in a statement. Stage 2 calls for 2,000MW to be shed rotationally load-shed nationally at a given period. In stage 3, 3,000MW must be shed, and 4,000MW must be shed under stage 4. "We remind customers that load-shedding at stage 4 is no cause for alarm as the system is being effectively controlled. Load-shedding is a highly-controlled process implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout. During stage 4 load-shedding, approximately 80% of the countryâ€™s demand is still being met," the parastatal said. The power utility said its maintenance teams were working around the clock to return generation units to the electricity system. "We appeal to customers to switch off geysers during the day as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Remember to treat all electrical points as live during load-shedding."
