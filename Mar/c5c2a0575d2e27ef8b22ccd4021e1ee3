Gqom musician Babes Wodumo is set to break her silenceÂ after allegedly being assaulted by her partner, Mandla Maphumulo, in a video clip that went viral. Video clips of a man believed to be Babes' longtime boyfriend, better known as Mampintsha, were apparently recorded from her Instagram Stories during the early hours of Monday morning. In the clip a man could be seen slapping Babes several times. South Africans have since called for Mampintsha to be boycotted and for him to face the wrath of the law.
