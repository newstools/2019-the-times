Thickleeyonce has made it her mission to continue talking about body positivity until people realise that fat shaming runs deeper than just an insult. The model and photographer has always been vocal about the effects fat shaming has on a woman and has encouraged others to love themselves wholeheartedly. Taking to Instagram, Thickleeyonce shared how she will never stop talking about body positivity. "How many more times are you going to talk about body positivity? Until the day you realise that fat shaming runs deeper than just you’re ugly and fat, you shouldn’t dress like that, it’s not appropriate for someone with your body type...cover up, no one wants to see that cellulite. "Fat shaming is not just an insult, fat shaming is institutional. It means being marginalized from countless job opportunities, activities, clothing companies, advertisements and at times being stripped of your human dignity because of how your body looks." Thickleeyonce believes that girls and women would have a higher self-esteem if the world didn't glorify conventional beauty, which makes the "rest of us feel bad about how we look". She questioned whether women would feel more confident if they were exposed to beauty that is relatable.
