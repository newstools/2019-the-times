A report into the intelligence service commissioned by President Cyril Ramaphosa and compiled by former minister Sydney Mufamadi has implicated the State Security Agency’s Special Operations Unit in illegal counter-intelligence activities aimed at propping up former president Jacob Zuma. “During the 2016 ANC January 8 statement in Rustenburg, the unit initiated three countering operations to impede the distribution of CR17 regalia, impede transportation system of dissident groups from GP [Gauteng],” according to the report.
