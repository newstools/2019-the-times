"Shortly after 11am, paramedics from ER24 and other services arrived on the scene where they found two vehicles with severe damage," said the paramedic service's Werner Vermaak. "One of the vehicles was towing a caravan at the time of the collision ... Paramedics found two occupants, one from each vehicle, showing no signs of life. Despite all their efforts, the paramedics were unable to regain any vital signs and they were declared dead on the scene. "Three other occupants had to be freed by the fire department from the wreckage. One was airlifted to hospital by a medical helicopter while the other two were rushed by ambulance to hospital. All three sustained serious injuries." Vermaak said the exact circumstances surrounding the collision were not yet known. "Local authorities attended the scene and will conduct an investigation."
