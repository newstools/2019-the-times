Men's fashion brand Billionaire is pushing the concept of luxury to the extreme with the launch of a pair of 24-carat pure gold sunglasses. This item is available to order from Billionaire stores worldwide. Designed to protect eyes from sunlight, sunglasses also add a touch of style and accessorise summer looks, as shown by the wide array on offer each year. Billionaire differentiates itself this year by releasing a pair of luxury, aviator-style shades in pure gold. A rare material in eyewear, the brand didn't stop there, going as far as to design the screws and lenses, produced by high-end eyewear manufacturer Dalloz, in this precious metal. Billionaire stresses that the use of gold is more than a mere gimmick, arguing that gold is the best infrared filter available among existing materials. These luxury shades are only available to order from Billionaire stores, and can be customised and personalised to make them unique. The company has announced a starting price of Â£12,000 (around R227,000) to own a pair of these exceptional sunglasses.
