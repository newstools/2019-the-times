Explosive details of how former Eskom boss Matshela Koko allegedly facilitated the looting of millions of rand from the Kusile power plant construction project have been exposed in reports presented to the SIU by a multi-national engineering company that scored a R2.2bn contract with the utility. The documents claim that Koko guaranteed Swiss engineering giant ABB future contracts worth R6.5bn if it subcontracted work on Kusile to Impulse International, a company part-owned by his stepdaughter. The company is one of 11 international engineering giants being investigated by the SIU for their role in looting about R139bn to build power stations. The documents detail how ABB colluded with Koko and senior executives at Eskom to win billions of rands in Eskom contracts. This is the first time a company with contracts at Eskom has linked Koko directly to corrupt activities at the utility and has given investigators evidence to back up its claims. Both Koko and Impulse owner Pragasen Pather have denied the claims, saying the contracts were awarded legitimately. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
