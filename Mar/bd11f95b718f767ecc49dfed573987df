Two schoolboys have been arrested after they allegedly raped a fellow pupil at a school in Reiger Park, Boksburg. The boys, aged 16 and 17, allegedly raped the 13-year-old on February 28. The name of the school has been withheld to protect the identity of the girl. "Apparently it happened in the morning [Wednesday]. They were on their way to school and when they reached the school the gate was already closed. "They took a shortcut and jumped the fence. The two boys grabbed the girl and took her into the bush and raped her," police spokesperson Cst Jan Mokwana said. Mokwana said other children filmed the ordeal. "The victim was too scared to tell her parents. Meanwhile, the boys were showing off the video at school to other pupils." The parents opened a rape case on Wednesday. The Gauteng department of education did not immediately comment.
