Some parts of the country will experience extreme weather conditions this weekend, ranging from severe thunderstorms to veld fires and heavy rains. The SA Weather Service said on Friday the Northern Cape would have "extremely high fire danger conditions" on Saturday. "It is very dry in that part of the country, so tomorrow [Saturday] there will be strong winds," said forecaster Bransby Bulo. He said the north-eastern part of the Eastern Cape and the central Free State could expect severe thunderstorms on Saturday. KwaZulu-Natal experienced heavy rainfalls on Friday which, according to Bulo, could result in flooding. KZN transport, community safety and liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has urged motorists to be cautious when driving as bad weather conditions persist. "We urge motorists to make sure that they switch on their lights and also keep a safe following distance," Kaunda said. "I urge all motorists to stay clear of parts where there is rainfall until the situation is back to normal. This weather is likely to persist throughout the day and possibly into the weekend, and all motorists are urged to ensure that vehicles are in a roadworthy state before undertaking any trips," he added.
