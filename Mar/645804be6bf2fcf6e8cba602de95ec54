The Gauteng roads and transport department is shutting down certain taxi routes in Johannesburg from Friday, following a spate of crimes. Gauteng roads and transport MEC Ismail Vadi said on Wednesday: "Practically, what this means is that specific taxi ranks and routes in Soweto will be shut down from Friday morning, March 15, for three months until June 15." The regulations were published in the provincial gazette in an effort to clamp down on the conflict between the Witwatersrand African Taxi Owners' Association (Wata) and Nancefield Dube West Taxi Association (Nanduwe). Vadi said: "It is necessary to shut down their minibus taxi services for the safety of commuters and residents of Soweto." The department said five murders, five cases of damaged property and one of public violence had been opened since the start of 2019. "Furthermore, on March 11, about 300 drivers purportedly linked to Wata and Nanduwe unlawfully blockaded with their vehicles the Johannesburg CBD, thereby creating a gridlock and disruption of traffic in the city centre for several hours." Anyone contravening the regulations could go to jail for six months or be fined R25,000. Here are the ranks and routes which will be closed:
