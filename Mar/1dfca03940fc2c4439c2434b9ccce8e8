A 44-year-old man was shot multiple times while sitting in his car in Kloof, west of Durban, paramedics said on Tuesday. Netcare911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics arrived at the scene at around 2.10pm. "Community members heard the sounds of gunshots ... and had alerted emergency services," he said. The man was in a critical condition. He was treated on the scene and flown to hospital via helicopter. KwaZulu-Natal police could not immediately comment on the matter. Earlier on Tuesday, two men were riddled with bullets after gunmen opened fire on their car on a busy Queen Nandi Drive in Avoca Hills, in the north of Durban. The two male occupants of the car sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Herbst said they were in a critical condition.
