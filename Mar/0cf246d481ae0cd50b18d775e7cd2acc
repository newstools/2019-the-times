Self-proclaimed Ghetto King Zakes Bantwini gave us a glimpse of his saucy dance moves on his Instagram page. Shuu, fam. Zakes's dance moves are out of this world! Like, we always knew he could bust a young Thuso Phala or gwara but dude took it to the next level recently with an Instagram video of himself getting down. Please donâ€™t try this at home, or on a slippery floor neh? Some of us are just queuing up for dance classes.
