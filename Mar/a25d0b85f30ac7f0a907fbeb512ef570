The Allandale substation in Midrand is back online after it was shut down due to an oil leak after a fire on Wednesday. “We can confirm that power has been fully restored to areas around Tembisa and Midrand, that include Rabie Ridge, Mayibuye, affected by the total shutdown early today [Wednesday] at the Allendale substation due to oil leak,” City Power tweeted on Thursday evening. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said in a tweet on Friday that they were investigating what caused the fire at the substation. “No foul play suspected at this stage,” Phasiwe said. “The Allandale substation is now back on service following an explosion on Wednesday.” City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said on Thursday that the substation was shut down as a precautionary measure to avoid a “possible disaster” after an oil leak.
