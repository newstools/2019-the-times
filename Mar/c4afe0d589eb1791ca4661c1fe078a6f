Hundreds of EFF supporters continued to pour into the Chatsworth Stadium, south of Durban, on Sunday afternoon, where thousands more had already gathered for the party's provincial manifesto launch. EFF commander in chief Julius Malema was expected to address supporters at 1pm but by had yet to deliver his keynote address at the Maphiniki Sports Complex in the Northern Cape. According to the EFF's official Twitter account, Malema was meant to address supporters in the Northern Cape at 10am and then travel to KwaZulu-Natal. Just after 2pm the EFF tweeted that Malema had arrived in the Northern Cape. There was a strong police presence in Chatsworth, ensuring there were minimal disruptions - barring a fight between a handful of supporters. EFF supports chant Senzo Meyiwa's name Despite this, an array of entertainment, with performances by local artists Lvovo, Big Nuz star Danger and Zandie Khumalo kept supporters in good spirits. EFF supporters shouted the name of slain Bafana Bafana star, Senzo Meyiwa, when Kelly Khumalo took to the stage. Khumalo had been dating Meyiwa when he was fatally shot. After performing one song and getting ready to perform another, Khumalo signalled the DJ and said "one more and then I'm out of here" after members of the crowd towards the back of the stadium grew louder with chants of Meyiwa's name. Gqom star Babes Woduma was yet to take the stage. In the wake of major unrest in the province pertaining to a high-profile political murder case, ongoing issues of a lack of basic services and high levels of corruption and crime, Malema's KZN keynote address was expected to be a major talking point and subjected to scrutiny by opposition parties vying to gain a foothold in the country's third-poorest province.
