Supermodel and philanthropist Naomi Campbell has pledged to change perceptions about Africa. British-born Campbell - who was one of five supermodels who revolutionised the fashion industry in the 90s - addressed media on Thursday ahead of  the Forbes Africa Leading Women Summit where she will be the headline speaker on Friday. Campbell said Africa has always been priority to her, especially after the death of late statesman Nelson Mandela. "I look forward to shining a bright spotlight on Africa and its inspirational women. I pledge to change perceptions about Africa worldwide." She said it was her second visit to Durban, her first being during the soccer World Cup in 2010. She has used her celebrity status to draw attention to several international charities, among them the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. Sihle Zikalala, Kwazulu-Natal MEC  for economic affairs, said Campbell's presence at the summit would serve as an inspiration to young women.
