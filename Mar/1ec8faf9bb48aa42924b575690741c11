National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole has condemned the "senseless" killings of two off-duty police officers in separate incidents in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. In the first incident, a warrant officer was killed in Amanzimtoti on the N2 highway, south of Durban, on Friday. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said the officer was travelling on the highway when shots were fired at his vehicle from a white Audi A3. Muridili said his bullet-riddled bakkie was found on the side of the road. The police officer’s body was found in the middle of the road with multiple gunshot wounds. A second officer was killed in the small town of Kranskop while investigating a suspicious car at a "shisa nyama outlet" after 9pm on Friday evening. "As soon as he walked out, he was met with bullets from the occupants of the suspicious vehicle," Muridili said. A young man was declared dead on the scene after being hit by stray bullets. Two other community members, who were also hit by stray bullets, were recovering in hospital. The 72-hour activation plan was implemented to "crack the cases".
