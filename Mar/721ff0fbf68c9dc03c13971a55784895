New South Africa Under-23 coach David Notoane has named a strong provisional 27-man squad as the junior national team prepare to begin their path towards the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in two-and-a-half weeks’ time. Notoane‚ appointed last week‚ has included a number of players who have played for South Africa at the U-17 Fifa World Cup in Chile in 2015 and the 2017 U-20 World Cup in South Korea. Among notable inclusions in the squad‚ which the coach will trim to 23 on Monday‚ are strikers Lyle Foster of Monaco‚ Phakamani Mahlambi of Mamelodi Sundowns and Luther Singh of GD Chaves in Portugal. The defenders include Ajax Cape Town’s Thendo Mukumela‚ Keanu Cupido of Cape Town City‚ and the Kaizer Chiefs duo of Siyabonga Ngezana and new Amakhosi signing Reeve Frosler. An array of midfield talent includes SuperSport United’s Teboho Mokoena‚ wingers Gift Links of Cape Town City and Fagrie Lakay of Bidvest Wits‚ Ajax Cape Town playmaker Grant Margeman and Thabo Cele of Cova da Piedade in Portugal. The Olympic team meet Angola in Luanda on Friday‚ March 22‚ with the return leg scheduled at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday‚ March 26 in a 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualifier. The South Africans were given a bye through the preliminary round‚ where Angola had a walkover against Namibia. If SA beat Angola‚ they will meet Mozambique or Zimbabwe for a place at the eight-team U-23 Afcon in Egypt in November‚ where the top three teams reach the Olympics.
