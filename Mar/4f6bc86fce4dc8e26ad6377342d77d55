Zoleka Mandela, who is dealing with depression tugged at the heartstrings of many women when she penned a sweet letter to her newborn baby girl to assure her that no matter how sad she feels, she loves her unconditionally. The author of When Hope Whispers took to Instagram to share the letter in which she revealed that she has found herself increasingly sad and that has resulted in her daughter witnessing more tears from her. "Zizi, baby... I feel like all you ever see or hear me do is cry almost everyday and since before your birth, I find myself increasingly more sad with each day that passes but I want you to know that birthing you and your two brothers (Zwelami and Zenawe) and two sisters (Zenani and Zanyiwe) has and will always be the ultimate height of my happiness and growth." Zoleka explained that some days depression threatened to hide her blessings from her but that she would never succumb to that power because of her children. "Someone once said to me that it is okay to cry because no plant ever grows without water, so even when I battle to hide my tears from you, know that it’s one of those days where mommy’s depression makes it so difficult to pretend that she’s okay all the time ... and that’s okay because she’s nurturing her inner child, getting the help that she needs and more determined not to struggle in silence again. "I love you and I want you to know that I am still as committed as ever to be the best version of myself so I can fully live in the reality of one my biggest blessings, and that’s being a mother you all deserve." Zoleka said that crying was not always a sign of weakness and is actually a great way to release all the pain and anger she had harboured for years.
