Concertgoers who attended the first of two Ed Sheeran concerts held at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday expressed delight at how well the event was planned and how safe it was. The safety of concertgoers was in stark contrast to the Global Citizen Festival at the same venue in December 2018, where scores were mugged outside the stadium with no police in sight. Many people remarked about how tight the security was and offered reassurances to others attending the event on Sunday. Four suspects were arrested for smash-and-grab incidents targeting the cars of concert fans on Saturday, police said. The Johannesburg metro police (JMPD) said it was well prepared for the two concerts and had deployed 114 officers, 53 traffic wardens, 47 patrol cars and eight horses on Saturday and Sunday to manage and control traffic in and around the stadium precinct. The Gautrain was also running a dedicated service to and from the FNB stadium for the two concerts. All concertgoers using Gautrain were being taken by a shuttle bus from Johannesburg Park station to the stadium. The drop-off and pick-up points were located at the transport hub, closer to the stadium to ensure pedestrian safety. The transport hub was fenced off and had additional lighting. The transport hub also accommodated those using the park-and-ride facility at the Ticketpro Dome. Uber also had a designated pick-up point at the stadium. Stadium Management SA also offered advice for fans to make their stay safe at theÂ  stadium. Johannesburg MMC for safety Michael Sun was part of the patrol activities on Saturday and said he would do it again on Sunday.
