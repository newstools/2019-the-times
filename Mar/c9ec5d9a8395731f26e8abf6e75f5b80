It was all smooches between rapper AKA and Dj  Zinhle as the two publicly shared a kiss before Zinhle took the stage in Umlazi, south of Durban, on Monday morning. The pair, who have a three-year-old daughter, were the headline acts at the East Coast Radio music takeover. The event saw the pair, along with Durban duo Distruction Boyz, performing  live on a stage that was elevated to the level of a four-metre billboard. "This was such a dope event to be a part of and I commend ECR for thinking outside the box and doing something different, bringing us to the people of Umlazi," said the rapper after his performance. After AKA ended his gig, he shared a quick kiss with DJ Zinhle as she was about to take the stage. The pair have been rumoured to be back together after the Fela in Versace hitmaker broke up with media personality Bonang Matheba last year. The two, however, have publicly denied rumours that they are an item, saying they are just co-parenting. ECR management didn't want to comment on the amorous moment. Traffic was at a standstill near the Umlazi Mega City as motorists stopped to see the first ever “live billboard" performance. "It was a really weird feeling performing, as a DJ, on a Monday morning, on the side of the road. I’m am really excited to be a part of this," said DJ Zinhle.
