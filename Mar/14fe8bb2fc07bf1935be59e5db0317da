The DA Gauteng Disciplinary Committee has suspended Ekhuruleni city councillor Thina Bambeni, who now faces charges of damaging the party’s good name, as well as making an unsubstantiated sexual harassment complaint against DA council caucus chairman Shadow Shabangu. Bambeni’s sexual harassment complaint filed in July last year was dismissed by the disciplinary committee, which instead found that her complaint was without evidence or substance. She has also been disqualified from the party’s parliamentary candidates list. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
