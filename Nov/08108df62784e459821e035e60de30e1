SAA employees will go on strike from Friday morning. This after the airline and two unions – the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) – could not reach an agreement over wages during last-minute talks to avoid industrial action. Speaking at the OR Tambo International Airport on Thursday, the unions confirmed that an agreement could not be reached. SACCA president Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi said: “We are going on strike tomorrow [Friday]. For definite. We're not backing down.” SAA has cancelled flights for Friday and Saturday due to the strike action. The airline has said the strike could cost it R50m a day. This is a developing story.
