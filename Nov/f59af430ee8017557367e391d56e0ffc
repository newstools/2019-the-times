A man who is planning to propose to his girlfriend woke up at about 4am on Friday to get to the mall to buy a “gorgeous” engagement ring for a discounted price. “She doesn’t know, but I’m so excited about our lives together. I saw this ring about a week ago and I wanted it for her. I hope she loves it and says yes,” said Kevin Bailey*. “She is also doing her shopping, but I had to lie and say I’m off to the bathroom so I can do my thing,” he told TimesLIVE. He selected a 9-carat, white gold diamond band that went for R3,999 on the #BlackFriday sale. He saved R1,999. He and his girlfriend have been together for four years. “The fact that I’m buying it on sale means nothing, it’s beautiful and I like it so much. She’s so patient and humble, this is it,” said the hopeful boyfriend. *Real name withheld so we don't pre-empt the proposal.
