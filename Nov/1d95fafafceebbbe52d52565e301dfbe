The difficulty, however, is that despite one’s best efforts, every person has likely found themselves feeling drowsy behind the wheel. What should you do in such a scenario this holiday season on the way to your destination?

Whether this is stopping for something healthy to eat, to rest your eyes or to just stretch your legs, listen to the signals your body gives you.” Herbert provides the following tips should you feel drowsy while driving: Falling asleep behind the wheel can have tragic consequences for many people. “Rather react as soon as you feel your eyes drooping than risk these consequences,” advises Herbert.
