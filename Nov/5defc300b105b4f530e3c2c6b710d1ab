Luyanda Botha, who confessed to the rape and murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana, has been given three life sentences. He was also given five years on a charge of defeating the ends of justice. Botha pleaded guilty to the crimes, the Cape Town high court heard on Friday morning. He entered a into a plea and sentencing agreement with the state. The state had consulted Mrwetyana's family, the court heard. “I understand the charges,” Botha said softly when asked by Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe if he understood the implications of the plea. In an admission read by his counsel, Botha confessed that he walked out of the post office and consumed alcohol at a nearby outlet after raping and murdering Mrwetyana. “I am liable of my intentions, as I intended to rape and murder,” he said in the admission.
