Join us on a journey of discovery for gin drinkers as four local and four international finalists battle it to be named “most loved gin” by our panel of judges and by South Africans across five cities. The top four finalists of both the local and international categories of the second Sunday Times Lifestyle Gin Awards in partnership with Makro and Fitch & Leedes have been announced. View the finalists in the article below: The awards celebrate the creators and retailers of locally and internationally crafted gins and variants.
