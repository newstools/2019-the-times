The supply in reservoirs distributing water across Tshwane through the Rand Water supply system has “plummeted substantially” and the outflow is now being throttled. The city pleaded with residents on Wednesday to conserve water. MMC for utility services Abel Tau said the situation had reached a “worrisome state”. “With our reservoir levels at an average of 35%, we appeal to residents and other high-volume water consumers to change their behaviour,” said Tau in a statement. “As a result of consumers’ failure to heed calls to use water sparingly, Rand Water has had to restrict supply throughout the city by 30%-50%.” Rand Water had experienced low water levels since October after two purification plants failed as a result of veld fires, an emergency shutdown after a valve malfunction, a heatwave and delayed rains. “In light of this, the city will henceforth introduce water resource management practice. This will entail throttling the outflow valves of all reservoirs at night so the reservoirs can recover to acceptable levels for the next day, when they will be opened again [subject to quantity improvement]," said Tau.
