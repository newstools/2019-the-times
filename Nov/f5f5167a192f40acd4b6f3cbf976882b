Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has, in the past, been dragged for his personal life and dress sense. This week, he faced the Twitter firing squad for his spelling. Itu was out for a meal with his sister on Monday and posted a snap of them living their best lives. But poor Itu was soon the talk of the TLs for spelling "brunch" wrong. Instead, he wrote that he was having “branch” with his sister. It was chaos as the spelling police came for the footballer. Itu laughed off the moemish, sending a face-palm emoji to a follower who called him out.
