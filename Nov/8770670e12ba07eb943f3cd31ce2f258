Queen of vosho Zodwa Wabantu gets her morning off to a great start by "drinking water and minding her own business". She took to Instagram to post a video encouraging fans to always wake up with a positive attitude. Also, can we just talk about how madam is just out here in a bikini on a random morning. She said that having a positive attitude all the time is her way of sticking it to haters, who constantly try and pull her down. But not today Satan!
