A 25-year-old man was arrested in Modimolle on Friday morning after being found in possession of two rhino horns, Limpopo police said. The suspect was arrested during an intelligence-led joint operation dubbed “Loreal” and comprising members of the Modimolle Crime Intelligence Unit, Modimolle Crime Prevention and the Endangered Species Unit. “The police acted on a tip-off from members of the community about a suspect carrying wild animal parts at a local filling station and immediately followed his movements. “The suspect was approached, searched and that's when they discovered two rhino horns concealed in a plastic bag inside a bag pack. The horns are valued at about R210,000,” police said. The suspect will appear in the Modimolle magistrate’s court on Monday,  facing a charge of possession of rhino horns.
