She may drop bars about pulling up in a four-door Audi, but rapper Nadia Nakai is no longer cruising around in that ride. Instead, sis has “upgraded” to a Mercedes-Benz C220 convertible and a V-Class minivan. “Back then, I had an Audi and a H1. Now I have upgraded to Mercedes-Benz C220 convertible and a Mercedes-Benz V-Class,” she told DJ Sabby on Ignition TV's Celeb Rides. It is a long way from her days driving a red Fiat Palio. “My door didn't lock from the inside. I couldn't open my window. My clutch was a situation. That car literally got me through varsity.” Nadia took Sabby for a ride in her van and opened up about her car journey. Celeb Rides airs every Saturday evening on Ignition TV (DStv channel 189) at 8PM. Fans got a hint of Nadia's car collection two years ago when she took to Instagram to show off her Audi, which she eventually swapped out for a Mercedes. Since then, her cars have featured in several Instagram posts. Cava:
