There's never a dull moment in Mzansi and every day we prove just how much we don't deserve the internet and this #paperdancechallenge is just one reason why social media is problematic and ironically hilarious! A video of a man showing his snazzy moves at a groove dominated social media. The man who is clearly enjoying himself does some unconventional dance moves as he licks his glass of beer and plays around with it to the beat of the song. You'd think it would look weird but it actually looks fun, fun enough to have been turned into a challenge. More than his dance moves, the man has become viral because he's likened to how older men - usually blessers - dance at parties or clubs. Especially if they are footing the bill and you have no choice but to let them flourish because well moreki! The imitation video were hilarious though.
