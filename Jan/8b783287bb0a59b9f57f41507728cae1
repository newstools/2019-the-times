DA leader Mmusi Maimane is writing his party’s manifesto on the back of an envelope - if a Twitter post on Tuesday is any guide Maimane posted a photograph of himself in his parliamentary office, with pen poised over the back of a white A4 envelope. "Looking at the draft manifesto. Look forward to sharing a vision for SA on 23rd of Feb," he tweeted. Times Select columnist Tom Eaton was quick on the draw, replying: "This picture makes me very happy. Not nearly enough people write on the backs of open envelopes." To which Maimane replied: "Absolutely. It’s a missed opportunity for all of us." @bravedave99 asked: "Is that the DA’s blank back-of-the-envelope manifesto you’re looking at?" Roger Lishman told Eaton: "I always thought the stub of a pencil and the back of an envelope was a euphemism. Or is that an euphemism, to be pedantic?"
