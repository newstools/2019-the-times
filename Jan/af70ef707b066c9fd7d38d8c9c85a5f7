Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga did not resign on his own accord but was forced by the DA to choose between the city and running for the premiership of Gauteng. Msimanga made a shock announcement on Friday that he would leave the Tshwane mayoral post at the end of February to focus on his candidacy for the premiership of Gauteng.
