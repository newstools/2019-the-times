Lunch-time shoppers were evacuated at Durban’s Musgrave Centre on Monday, after the mall was told that a bomb had been planted on the premises. The police’s explosives unit was deployed to sweep the building. But according to police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane, "nothing suspicious was found". Zwane said the caller claimed the bomb was in the parking lot. "A search was conducted and nothing was found. A case of bomb threat has been opened at the Berea police station for investigation," he said.
