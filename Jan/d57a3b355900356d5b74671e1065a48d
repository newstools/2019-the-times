Two people were attacked at gunpoint in Mayfair, Johannesburg, after being followed back from OR Tambo International Airport, police said on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said the complainant told police that he was followed back from the airport after he picked up a friend on Monday evening. Mogale said they were confronted by two men, who travelled in a Volkswagen GTI, on the corners of 8th Avenue and Langerman Street in Mayfair. "The suspects fired a shot, which was most probably to threaten them. They took his cellphone, cash and the bags belonging to his friend," said Mogale. The men fled the scene. No injuries were reported.
