BidAir Services at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport on Thursday suspended one of its employees for "mishandling luggage". It acted after a video was shared on social media in which the woman is seen taking the bags off the baggage carousel and carelessly throwing them on the ground. Passengers look on as the woman continues to throw the bags off the carousel. Airport spokesperson Samukelo Khambule said after seeing the video they had engaged with BidAir regarding its employee's behaviour. BidAir had identified the baggage handler and suspended her with immediate effect. The woman would also face disciplinary action. "There are many professional employees who work for various companies in the airport ecosystem. "Itâ€™s therefore disconcerting when an employee falls short of the standards of the service level agreement that we have with companies performing licensed activities within the airport," Khambule said. Several social media users have shared their frustrations on the post on Facebook. "The behaviour of someone who never travels, never took a plane in their entire life. You can smell jealousy, hatred, lack of interest from far. "I pray this video reaches the heads of O.R Tambo, Emirates, and all these real airlines companies that cares about their customers to see how they can be held responsible for the damages caused by a poor jealous person who never went overseas. Poor people mindset, just as it is!" a comment read. A second comment read: "She clearly doesn't know the price of luggage to be throwing it around like that, hope you send this to someone high up at the airport to see just how fantastic their staff are." A woman commented that she had had to replace her luggage bags twice. "True story 2nd time in 1 year. almost new bag. both wheels gone," she said.
