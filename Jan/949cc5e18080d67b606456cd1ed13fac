An inspection  by the city of Tshwane has revealed that two of the halls that house Shepherd Bushiri's church congregants do not comply with safety regulations. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga told a hearing, held by the CRL Rights Commission, that the emergency services department conducted a site inspection at halls D and H at the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG). The hearings follow a stampede that resulted in the deaths of three women at the church.Â Bushiri appeared before the hearing on Monday to explain how the women died and others were injured on December 28. "The escape routes leading to the escape doors are obstructed, escape doors to be used during an emergency were obstructed [and] there was insufficient firefighting equipment provided," Msimanga said. He said the report from the emergency services department also revealed that the halls did not have emergency lights, that there were no emergency evacuation plans available and that there was a diesel trailer  stored on the premises. The report, according to Msimanga,  noted  there was no proper seating arrangement and that judging by the number of chairs stacked in the halls, the population of the church was high during sermons. The report also found  people  sleeping on the property and  preparing food, posing a health hazard. "It is for these reasons that the city will issue an order to comply. If after 30 days the requisite levels of compliance have not been met, it may result in a prohibition notice being issued which requires the occupier to cease any and all activity," Msimanga said. The hearing continues.
