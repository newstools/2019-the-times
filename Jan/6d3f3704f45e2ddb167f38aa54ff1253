While several provinces, including Mpumalanga,Â Gauteng, the Free State and North West are experiencing cloudy conditions on Monday, residents of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape have reported something rather peculiar in their clear blue skies. The SA Weather Service has sent out a message explaining what the ring seen around the sun is believed to be. "This phenomena is called a halo, which is produced by the refraction of light by ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere," the weather service said.
