Imagine stopping for a chat and a lion rudely interrupting your conversation. Tourists from Kruger 5 Safaris were en route to Lower Sabie in the Kruger National Park when they stopped to have a look at a committee of vultures merrily munching on a kill. They started having a chat with a couple in an Audi when a lioness exploded on to the scene, scattering the birds. The animal then trundled off with the impala kill to feed in peace.
