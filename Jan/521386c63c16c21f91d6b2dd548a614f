Unathi added that she would not "bullied" and that the lights were definitely on in her home. "I will not be bullied for posting the video that I did. I have posted it again so that South Africa knows how you treat women who know they have a right to complain.PS I’m sitting in my house as I post this and my lights are on." Meanwhile, City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena told Sunday Sun that their contractors were apparently "patient and polite" and provided identification.
