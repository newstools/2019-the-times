This week on Africa Weekly, we travel to Somalia, where the countryâ€™s only free ambulance service is at risk of closing down due to lack of funding. We also take a look at a new doll being produced in Burkina Faso that challenges the blue-eyed Barbie dolls. Then we turn towards Cape Town for its colourful minstrels, who attracted thousands of people to their Tweede Nuwe Jaar festival on January 2.
