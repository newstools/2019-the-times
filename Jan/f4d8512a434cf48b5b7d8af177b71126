Julia Anastasopoulos might be the star of the hit web series SuzelleDIY and have her own Showmax series, Tali's Wedding Diary, but at the end of the day she's still just an ordinary woman trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood and a career. Anastasopoulos posted a long Instagram message about struggling to get things done while being a mother to a six-month-old baby girl who is "needy and teething". The aim of her confession was to show that even though she loves celebrating her daughter's many milestones with beautiful snaps on Instagram, these sorts of photos don't tell the "whole story" of what it's like being a mother 24/7. "Although it may seem like I have my sh*t together, I promise you that 80% of the time I’m in a tired pair of leggings covered in mushed up pieces of peach and a baby clinging to my hip," Anastasopoulos wrote on Instagram. "There are gloriously wonderful parts of this motherhood thing ... but there are also hard parts and it really is exhausting and relentless — especially when you need to work and function as if you are your old self." Anastasopoulos is one of many celebrities who have come forward to out Martha Stewart-esque depictions of motherhood on social media as being an illusion. Others include TV producer Shonda Rhimes, who talks about there being no such thing as "a balance" while being a working mom in her TED talk, and Naptime With Joey author Laura Izumikawa who recently uploaded an Instagram post showing that there are two sides to every idyllic baby photo. Moms everywhere need to be encouraged to let go of the idea that they need to always be perfect, which is why the many women commenting on Anastasopoulos’ post were grateful for her honesty.
