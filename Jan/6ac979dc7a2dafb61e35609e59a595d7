A car driver, who apparently suffered a seizure and blacked out, crashed through the boundary wall of a home in Toby Street in Sophiatown, Johannesburg, on Sunday, injuring a woman sitting in her lounge. Paramedics arrived at 11:26am to find the vehicle lodged partway through the front window of the house, said ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell. “Both the 63-year-old driver and the 28-year-old woman were taken to hospitals in the area, where they were treated for moderate injuries. “Saps were on the scene for further investigation,” Campbell said.
