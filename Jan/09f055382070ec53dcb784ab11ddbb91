The Electoral Commission called on eligible voters to register and update their address details on Sunday - the final day of registration at the country's 22,925 voting stations ahead of the upcoming national and provincial elections. "Voting stations will be open today until 17h00. Thereafter voters will only be able to register at their local IEC office during working hours – and only for a brief period until the elections are proclaimed. Once proclaimed, the voters’ roll for the 2019 national and provincial elections is closed," the commission said in a statement on Sunday. Almost all voting stations were open and operational by 11am on Sunday. "In the few areas where community protests were still preventing voting stations from opening this morning, electoral staff supported by SA Police Service personnel are liaising with community leaders to ensure stations would open as soon as possible." The commission thanked community leaders, local government representatives, traditional leaders and police for their support in ensuring voter registration activities could continue.
