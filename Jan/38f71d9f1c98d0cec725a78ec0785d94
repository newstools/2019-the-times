A pair of local hotels have been voted among the top 10 hotels in Africa in the 2019  Travellers' Choice Awards, a ranking system based on comments posted by the users of TripAdvisor. The Oyster Box in Umhlanga Rocks, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Cape Grace in Cape Town, came in second and sixth place respectively. The Oyster Box was beaten to the top spot by Constance Prince Maurice in Mauritius. "The Oyster Box offers all the colonial charm and nostalgia of a bygone era, but with all the modern comfort and amenities," TripAdvisor says of the second-best hotel in Africa. The travel website describe the Cape Grace as "a welcoming and gracious sanctuary of tradition, sophistication and contemporary comfort." Although the two hotels placed highly in the Africa category, no SA getaways made it onto the list of the top 25 hotels in the world in this year's Travellers' Choice Awards. The hotel named the world's best was Tulemar Bungalows & Villas in Costa Rica's Manuel Antonio National Park. With 33 acres of rainforest and a private beach, Tulemar Bungalows & Villas offers travellers a chance to connect with nature. Some of the rooms look out over its gardens while others have views of the sea, TripAdvisor says.
