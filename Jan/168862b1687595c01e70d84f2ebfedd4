A foreigner has been arrested for selling abortion pills at a fast food outlet in central Cape Town. Western Cape police spokesman FC van Wyk said the 38-year-old was caught in an undercover operation on Wednesday by narcotics unit officers. "They received information that prescribed drugs are being sold at a fast food outlet in Strand Street," he said. "An undercover agent went in and purchased an abortion tablet (Misoprostol) for R1,000. The suspect was arrested on a charge under the Medicines Control Act. "Upon further searching of the suspectâ€™s bag, 259 abortion tablets and 175 Adco tablets valued at R270,000 were also seized." Van Wyk said the suspect was due to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Friday.
