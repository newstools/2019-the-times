Say hello to a new year, new me, new book-look! We’re ecstatic to announce that BooksLIVE has joined the Sunday Times’ digital sphere and will henceforth be known as Sunday Times Books. Stay up to date with leading titles from prominent South African publishers, international literary news, and local-is-lekker events on the brand-new site right here on TimesLIVE. And yes, you can continue getting your daily dose of mahala book news as all our book-related articles will be free to read. Perusing the website for the genre of your choice is easier than ever, with separate sections catering for both the fiction fans and non-fiction enthusiasts. Author interviews, awards announcements, calls for submissions, information about literary festivals and more are now a mere click away in our news section. Staunch supporters of book launches will soon also have an events section to ensure they don’t miss out on any forthcoming dos. But most importantly of all: enjoy!
