Black First Land First (BLF) member Zimasa Mpemnyama has distanced herself from a series of “manufactured” tweets – in her name – lashing out at the EFF and claiming protesters were paid R1m to cause a “race riot” on Clifton Fourth Beach. “Yesterday my account was suspended on Twitter, then I find tweets like this, which I never wrote, circulating,” she said in a tweet on Tuesday. “I would never write such hogwash about killing black people. Stop spreading lies,” she said. “Here are the other tweets which were manufactured. I never wrote these tweets. Right wingers shared these pictures after they got my account suspend to tarnish mine & BLF's name. "I would never use the term 'race riots' plus I know how to spell 'slaughtering' - Thank you very much." WARNING: The tweet below contains strong language. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama suggested that the tweets were photoshopped to incite "black-on-black violence".
