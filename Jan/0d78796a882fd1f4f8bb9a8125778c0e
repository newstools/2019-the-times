Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi will continue his testimony before the state capture commission on Monday. Over the past two weeks, Agrizzi has alleged that high-level government and ANC officials were involved in corrupt deals with Bosasa. These included allegedly helping Bosasa and its companies secure more than R10bn worth of government tenders. The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that the Watson family was prepared to do anything to keep Agrizzi quiet, including offering him an R80m hush fund. An e-mail to Agrizzi from Bosasa lawyer Brian Biebuyck in September 2018 contained a proposed agreement revealing an elaborate web to make the payments appear legitimate. In exchange for these payments, Agrizzi was to back out of an undertaking he had given the media to release details of corruption at Bosasa and try to “reverse the negative publicity that was attracted due to the statement, particularly with regards to the clients and financial institutions related to the business”. Gavin Watson did not respond to questions posed by the Sunday Times.
