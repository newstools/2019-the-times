In celebration of its 107th birthday, the ANC has erected statues of its past leaders along the M4 in Durban North, but everyone is asking, who is the man next to Nelson Mandela? The statues  include ANC leaders and stalwarts including Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma, Cyril Ramaphosa as well as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and Albertina Sisulu. Mbeki's statue caught the eyes of many on social media who were questioning who the man standing between Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma was, saying that the statue did not resemble the former president. The statue of Thabo Mbeki sparked many reactions on Twitter with many questioning the resemblance. Meanwhile, the DA in KwaZulu-Natal has written to eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza requesting details regarding reports that the municipality is planning to spend R20m on new statues of Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela. The statues will be unveiled later this year.
