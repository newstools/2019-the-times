Kaizer Chiefs fans had high hopes for 2019, but the team failed to impress in its first match of the year. Amakhosi lost 2-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns on January 5 2019, and it was a huge blow for fans. Goalkeeper Virgil Vries manned the posts for Chiefs in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, who is out of action due to a shoulder injury. Fans blame an error by Vries for the loss. The goalkeeper misjudged a cross, which Lebohang Maboe netted to give Sundowns the win. Perhaps better days are ahead for the team following management’s commitment to strengthening the squad during the current transfer window. According to Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp, the club is looking at what the market has to offer and which players are available as possible additions to the team. “That’s the next question and both have to be done with the knowledge that we have this recruiting and scouting department, and people here inside doing this,” said Middendorp. At the end of Saturday’s match, Chiefs were ranked number eight on the PSL log and fans took to Twitter to share their disappointment. Opposition fans took the opportunity to shade the losers.
