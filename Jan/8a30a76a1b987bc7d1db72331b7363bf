The election fever is high and whether Mzansi is ready or not it looks like the convo around politicians and their "opportunistic presence" is already in full swing, with Lerato Kganyago leading the charge. The radio star took to Twitter this week to discuss the upcoming elections and asked her followers what issues they thought needed to be addressed by political parties. She also encouraged fans to share questions they may have for politicians ahead of the elections and shared her own. Lerato's question was specific to the entertainment industry. She questioned why political parties only seemed to recognise artists when they needed them to help mobilise people. While the question sparked a healthy debate in the comments section, it also caught the attention of politician Fikile Mbalula. Mbaweezy has never been one to back down from a twar and soon he was warming up those Twitter fingers to have his say. But Lerato thought Fikile's answer had a "whiff of intimidation" and made it clear that she was not about that life. Mbalula was quick to respond to the intimidation claim and said he wasn't trying to bully the presenter. Peace was eventually restored after a back and forth that lasted a couple of hours. Mbalula apologised for any intimidation he may have made Lerato feel. Lerato "accepted" the apology and moved on to other things.
