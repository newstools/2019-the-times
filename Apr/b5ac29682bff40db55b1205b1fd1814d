The Premier Soccer League (PSL) have confirmed the guilty verdict for Mamelodi Sundowns for fielding ineligible player Wayne Arendse in a 1-1 Absa Premiership draw against Bidvest Wits. The PSL said in a statement on Wednesday that a sentence is yet to be made. Sundowns fielded defender Arendse as a late change in their 1-1 Premiership draw against Wits at Lucas Moripe Stadium on October 7‚ when the player had not been named in the match squad of 18‚ which is in contravention of PSL regulations. “The Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee has delivered a verdict on matters involving Mamelodi Sundowns‚ Mr Wayne Arendse and Mr Pitso Mosimane‚” the league’s statement read. “In the first matter involving Mamelodi Sundowns and Wayne Arendse‚ the Disciplinary Committee found both the club and the player guilty of misconduct. “Sanction will be handed down once all the parties have made submissions to the Disciplinary Committee. The case is important as it may see league leaders Sundowns (44 points from 24 games) deducted points‚ and possibly points also awarded to third-placed Wits (41 from 24). In a separate matter‚ Downs coach Mosimane was found guilty of assaulting a security official in a 3-3 league draw against AmaZulu at King Zwelithini Stadium on Umlazi on September 16. “In the second matter arising from an incident between AmaZulu and Mamelodi Sundowns … Mr Pitso Mosimane was charged with misconduct after he allegedly assaulted AmaZulu team security official‚ Mr. Satchmo Ngwenya by punching him in the face. “Mamelodi Sundowns was charged for bringing the League into disrepute as a result of their coach’s actions. “Both the club as well as Mr Mosimane were found guilty. Sanction will be handed down once all the parties have made submissions to the Disciplinary Committee.”
