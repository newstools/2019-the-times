National police spokesperson Lt-Col Brenda Muridili said the search was part of their school safety programme. "Police were attacked with rocks by the students. They were with members of the Youth League," said Muridili. "There were allegedly two gunshots that went off when the students shot at the police, but no one was injured." She said one police car was damaged. It was still unclear how many officers were injured. A case of public violence has been opened. No arrests have been made.
