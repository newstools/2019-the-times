Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza on Thursday closed down a crèche in Carletonville after three videos - showing one of the educators assaulting children - went viral. Mayathula-Khoza visited the crèche on Thursday where she met the principal and some parents. "The teacher has already been arrested last Friday," Mayathula-Khoza told SAFM on Thursday. The MEC also told the principal of the crèche that it would be closed because, although it was registered in the 2015/2016 financial year, the registration was never renewed as required. "It shows us that the principal is all about income generation because the parents are paying R1,500 [a month]," Mayathula-Khoza said. Mayathula-Khoza said she had been told that these videos were taken about a year-and-a half ago, but they only surfaced a week or two ago. She said there were two educators at the school, the one who had been arrested and the one who took the videos "One wanted to extort some money from the principal. This is what the principal is saying. The principal said she got to know about the videos a week or two ago. She says she was not aware of the abuse," the MEC said.
