Musician and businessman DJ Sbu has once again faced the Twitter firing squad - this time he's been accused of "hijacking" the memorial service of late US rapper Nipsey Hussle. Sbu, who is currently in America, made a beeline for the site of Nipsey's death in Crenshaw, Los Angeles. He shot several videos from an impromptu memorial at the site this week and claimed to "represent the continent". But not everyone was impressed by the gesture and it quickly turned into a social media storm, with users claiming Sbu was just trying to steal the spotlight. They pointed to other times he had "hijacked" the limelight to punt his products and said he was quarter to busting out a MoFaya energy drink for everyone mourning Nipsey's death. Others applauded him for his bravery.
