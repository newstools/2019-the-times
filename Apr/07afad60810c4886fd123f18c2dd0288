Stormers captain Siya Kolisi flew home as part of Springbok resting protocols to leave the beleaguered Super Rugby tourists thin on experience as a result of injuries. This means Kolisi won’t play against the Rebels in Melbourne on Friday. It also leaves coach Robbie Fleck short of experienced heads after Eben Etzebeth and Pieter-Steph du Toit both returned to Cape Town last week. Lock Chris van Zyl‚ who captained Western Province to the Currie Cup title in 2017‚ sustained a back injury during last Friday’s 24-12 loss to the Reds and is also ruled out. Utility back SP Marais is also out of the last leg of the tour after suffering a hip flexor injury and Fleck has called for centre Dan Kriel and hooker Chad Solomons as replacements.
