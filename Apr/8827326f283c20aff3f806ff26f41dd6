A video of Rachel Kolisi speaking about the black and white theme of her wedding to Springbok captain Siya Kolisi resurfaced online this week, leaving many in stitches. The clip, from a 2016 interview with Top Billing, shows Rachel talking about her decision to go with black bridesmaid dresses for her big day. "We wanted to keep things nice and contrasted. Also with Siya being black and myself white, we wanted to kind of keep the theme and not have any random colours like pink or green." The comment tickled many on social media, including comedian Tumi Morake who shared her amusement at the clip. A few weeks ago Rachel got major backlash on social media  after she asked fans to help her locate a woman she claimed had sent Siya revealing DMs. Twitter users  flooded timelines with comments on this latest clip and calling for Rachel to get her own reality show.
