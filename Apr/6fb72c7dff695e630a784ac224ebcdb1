The ANC wished former president Jacob Zuma well on his 77th birthday on Friday. The governing party's spokesman, Dakota Lekgoete, said in a statement that many ANC members had learnt a lot from Zuma. Said Lekgoete: "It is a great privilege to see you reaching such a life milestone. We understand that you grew up in our country during a very difficult time but you and many cadres in your generation fought hard to free us from the yoke of apartheid. "Although you have retired, we acknowledge the role you continue to play in the movement. On behalf of the membership of the ANC, we extend our best wishes to you on this special day." Birthday wishes for Zuma were pouring in on Friday from individual leaders and structures in the ANC such as the party's beleaguered secretary-general (SG), Ace Magashule, and the ANC in KwaZulu Natal. Responding to a tweet by Magashule, Zuma, a well known ally of the troubled SG, said "stay resolute during these times". Zuma shares a birthday with his political nemesis, minister of public enterprises Pravin Gordhan whom he fired as finance minister in 2017. Gordhan turned 70 on Friday.
