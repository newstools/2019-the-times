A child in the care of a cousin was found dumped in a pit toilet in Gopane, near Zeerust in the North West, on April 5, five days after she went missing. Two suspects aged 24 and 25 were arrested later the same day and are expected to appear in the Lehurutshe magistrate's court on Monday on charges of murder and rape. The acting provincial commissioner of police in the North West Maj-Gen Ryno Naidoo commended a team comprising visible policing, detectives and K9 units for "working tirelessly" to find out what had happened to her, and to trace the suspects. Tlhalefo Mego, 11, who stayed with her cousin, left the house on Sunday, March 31 to visit a friend in Gopane village. "According to information received, the girl's cousin also left their place later to go to another section in the village. The girl's cousin arrived back home and found that a window was broken. She later discovered that the girl was not there. She allegedly went to sleep hoping that the girl will return home. "The girl was ultimately reported missing on Wednesday, April 3 2019, after she failed to return home," said Cpt Aafje Botma. During their investigation, Botma said information was received that Tlhalefo was dead and that her body had been dumped inside a pit toilet.
