The ANC has described a tongue-lashing delivered by its deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte, to a journalist as unfortunate and not in the spirit of a professional and mutually beneficial relationship. Duarte on Tuesday described eNCA journalist Samkele Maseko as arrogant, accused him of asking "attacking" questions and acting like a "lord of the media" during a briefing at Luthuli House. Following the incident, the ANC met the broadcaster and the South African National Editors' Forum (Sanef) on Wednesday in engagements ANC national spokesperson Dakota Legoete described as cordial and robust. "In both meetings, we agreed that the incident  between the deputy secretary-general of the ANC, Ms Jessie Duarte, and the eNCA reporter, Mr Samkele Maseko, was unfortunate and not in the spirit of a professional and mutually beneficial relationship. "The ANC acknowledges that healthy tension between political parties and the media is inherent in a democracy. Mutual respect, professional ethics and appreciation of each other's roles is central to managing this tension," Legoete said. "The ANC reiterated its commitment to media freedom, and assured both eNCA and Sanef that it would continue to defend and champion the mediaâ€™s right to report without fear or favour," he added. Legoete said the party would continue to hold regular engagements with Sanef and media houses.
