A man, believed to be in his 60s, was seriously injured when he lost control of his vehicle, causing it to crash in an underground parking area at a mall in Tokai, Cape Town. ER24 paramedics found the man lying next to his vehicle, which had come to rest against a low wall in the parking area on Thursday. "Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained serious injuries to his waist and leg, leaving him in a serious condition," said ER24's Russel Meiring. The man was treated at the scene, before being transported to hospital.
