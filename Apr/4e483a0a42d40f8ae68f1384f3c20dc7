Andrew Gurza calls himself a champion of queer and disability rights and made one of the boldest moves in his life by telling his mother he hires sex workers. In an open letter published in Huffington Post, Gurza said he made the decision to hire sex workers after he was tired of experiencing discrimination from able-bodied men. He said that when he made the decision a few years back to tell his mom that he hired sex workers, her response was supportive."You can just have sex. It doesn't need to be tied to love." Gurza, who is in a wheelchair, is very vocal on his social media accounts about loving sexual intercourse as a person living with a disability. Gurza uses the phrase #DisabledPeopleAreHot to inspire people living with disability to be sexually liberated and to create a positive image about  disability and sex.
