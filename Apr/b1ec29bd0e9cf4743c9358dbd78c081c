One of the last vacant sites in swanky Clifton - on the Cape’s Atlantic Seaboard - is set to go under the virtual hammer on Wednesday. The prime elevated 455m² plot is among 70 properties which will be auctioned off in BidX1 South Africa’s first on-line auction. According to the 2018 Africa Wealth Report, published by AfrAsia Bank and New World Wealth, property prices per square metre for Bantry Bay and Clifton were the most expensive in South Africa, at around R86,500, while Nettleton Road in Clifton remained the poshest address in the country. "With sweeping views across Clifton and the ocean, this  elevated  plot includes architecturally designed plans available for the successful, registered bidder," said BidX1 South Africa in a statement. Other prized properties in the Western Cape, which are expected to see competitive bidding are a four-bedroom, four-bathroom home in up-market Benguela Cove estate, a secure, private wine estate  between Kleinmond and Hermanus. In the scenic Balgowan area in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, two  adjoining sites "provide potentially lucrative investment opportunities". The sites are located close to some of SA’s best private schools such as Hilton and Michaelhouse. In Houghton, Johannesburg, two properties in upmarket Houghton estate will also come up for sale on the  auction. In addition, a number of bank properties in various locations would also be available for bidding.
