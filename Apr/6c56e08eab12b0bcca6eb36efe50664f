Pundits have called it the 'most unlikely win'. And after an 11-year dry spell, it's easy to see why Tiger Woods's historic victory at Augusta National to take his fifth Masters has been hailed as one of the most epic golfing wins of all time. Yes, he kept his calm as the odds seemed stacked against him. Sure, he was up against Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele. And after having spinal chord surgery in 2017 a win seemed even more unlikely. Even though Woods's victory is a 'win for the ages' it was his moment with his family that got everybody talking. It was the first time son Charlie Axel and daughter Sam Alexis got to see their dad take a major win and he rushed to his children with his arms open. The moment has been compared to his first major win in 1992, where he rushed to hug his father Earl. On social media, the commentary around the father and son moment all went along the lines of: 'I'm not crying, you're crying.'
