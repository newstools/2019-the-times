Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairman Irvin Khoza has said that football’s global ruling body Fifa do not allow political parties and religious organisations to campaign at stadiums in the sport. In the past fortnight the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and African National Congress (ANC) were visibly present at Orlando and Lucas Moripe Stadiums‚ in an Orlando Pirates vs Mamelodi Sundowns league game‚ and at a Sundowns vs Al Ahly Caf Champions League quarterfinal. Khoza said though the the league cannot allow political parties the platform to advertise or campaign‚ the PSL also cannot stop fans arriving at stadiums wearing the colours of their parties. “Fifa does not allow political parties adverstising [at soccer matches]‚” Khoza said. “Religious or political advertising is not allowed but if they come into the stadium we can’t stop them. We can’t give a platform where there is a campaign.” Khoza said the PSL will encourage South Africans to go out in May and exercise their right to vote. “What we can say as the League is that that it will be nice to convey a message that it is good for people to go and vote‚” he said. “Because if you vote‚ you will be able to give impetus. If you don’t vote you can’t say my street has potholes‚ the hospitals are not proper‚ transport services are not proper. “We can only encourage that as football – for people to have a say on how matters of this country are discussed because you have the right and a voice. “We are apolitical as football but clubs are supported by people who support various political parties and religious organisations.”
