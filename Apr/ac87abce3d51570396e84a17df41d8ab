Fans are uber excited that Kanye West is finally doing Coachella and bringing his whole church with him! Err'body who has been asking for the geolocation of Kanye's in the "wild" Sunday church, it seems God or whoever y'all have been praying to has heard your prayers and has sent down a pinned location for y'all in the form of Coachella! The announcement was totally unexpected as the musician has turned down the opportunity before as they didn't allow him to make some creative changes to the stage in the past. However, it seems like all is well between Ye and the organisers and he will be there on a Sunday to leave his people inspired by his "cult-like" church. Fans of the Jesus WalksÂ hitmaker have been exposed to his Sunday services via social media since it began a few weeks ago. Watch how excited folks were when he made the announcement. All the people that had been camping on Kim K's Instagram stories, hoping the spirit from Kanye's church would reach them, were super excited that they will finally have a chance to experience it. Fam... tweeps were outchea asking for the theme and if they need to go on a fast before attending the now popular church on social media! Here are some of the reactions.
