Former president Jacob Zuma has sent Twitter into hype mode with his response toÂ  claims that he stashed millions of dollars belonging to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi at his home in Nkandla. The explosive claims were made in the Sunday Times at the weekend. On Tuesday, two days after reports first surfaced, Zuma replied with a "sigh". Social media has been lit as South Africans respond to Zuma's tweet. Many were angry and demanded answers, while others simply laughed off the claims.
