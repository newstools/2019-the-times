Two men who escaped from the back of a police van have been re-arrested and are expected to appear in court on Monday. Mbongosi Mgoqi, 24, and Jason Witbooi, 22, were apprehended in the Storms River area of the Eastern Cape on Saturday. Police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said the pair escaped from a moving police van while being transported back to prison on Tuesday last week. The incident happened on the R62 and N2 on-ramp, near the Kareedouw and Humansdorp turn-off. The men are believed to have been hiding in the Kareedouw district. "The two, who were hitchhiking this morning, obtained a lift from an alert community member who recognised the two immediately and notified the police in Storms River," said Swart. After setting up a roadblock on the N2, officers pulled the vehicle with the two escapees off the road before re-arresting them on the spot. Swart said Witbooi had been arrested for the murder of a 69-year-old man on a farm in the Joubertina area in October 2018. Mgoqi head been sentenced to five years' imprisonment on 1 April on a charge of culpable homicide that occurred in August 2007. The two men are expected to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrateâ€™s Court on a charge of escape from lawful custody.
