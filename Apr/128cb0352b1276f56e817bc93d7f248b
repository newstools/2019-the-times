A case of armed robbery has been opened after a man was robbed of his watch worth R100,000 outside Kyalami Estates in Midrand. CCTV footage showed a white Porsche pulling up at the boom gates of the estate on Sunday, followed by a Volkswagen Polo. A few seconds later, two men quickly get out of the hatchback and run towards the Porsche. One of the men, carrying what appears to be a firearm, points at other cars nearby to reverse. After a short struggle, one of the robbers takes something through the window of the Porsche and jumps back into the Polo which speeds off. Police spokesperson Capt Mohlaume Mamabolo said the incident happened around noonÂ  on Sunday. "Two guys carrying firearms and masks got out of the car and robbed the driver of his watch worth R100,000," he said. Mamabolo said it was not a Rolex watch. No shots were fired and no arrests were made.
