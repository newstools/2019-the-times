Just hours before the start of the Easter weekend, 10 people died in a horrific accident on the N1 in Limpopo. Provincial transport and community safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said she was saddened by the accident, which took place on Thursday in Modimolle. "This is another sad day in our province. We have lost 10 people in an accident that could have been prevented if the required speed limit was adhered to. This is heart wrenching indeed," said Makhurupetje. Explaining what had happened, the departmentâ€™s spokesperson, Moremi-Taueatsoala, said a speeding taxi had veered out of control. "Preliminary findings shows that the accident happened after a speeding Toyota Combi lost control and collided head-on with a MAN truck, leaving 10 people dead and two others injured," said Moremi-Taueatsoala. The MEC expressed her condolences after visiting the scene. "Although the exact cause of this horrific accident is yet to be unravelled, I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the families of the ten people who lost their lives and further wish a speedy recovery to those injured," she said. Motorists have been urged to adhere to speed limits and rest, as fatigue is a leading factor in accidents. "Once again, government reminds motorists to stick to the required speed limit on the N1, which is 120km/hour. Anyone who infringes this rule is a risk not only to himself but to other road users. Motorists are also advised to rest in between trips as fatigue can be the biggest killer. "Limpopo is declared a zero-tolerance province against anyone caught not obeying the rules of the road this Easter," added Makhurupetje.
