The body of a baby boy has been found in a stormwater drain in the Eerste River area of Cape Town, not far from where a child went missing a week ago. Police spokesperson Lt-Col Andr√® Traut confirmed that the discovery was made on Tuesday afternoon. "A case of murder has been registered," he said. "It is too soon to speculate on the identity of the child or the circumstances surrounding the case at this stage." The body was found near the home of 22-month-old Orderick Lucas, who went missing just over a week ago.
