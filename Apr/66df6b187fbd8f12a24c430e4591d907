For those of you fell for the story about the Springboks changing their name - you got got. eNCA on Monday morning reported that the team had changed their name to "Zebras", to reflect the country's racial diversity, and the colours black and white would do exactly that. The report went on to "quote" one of the officials from the SA rugby association, who said the new black and white gear would debut in September during the World Cup. It is not yet known what Botswana's national football team thought of the change - Bafana Bafana's counterparts really are nicknamed the Zebras. While some tweeps caught on to the prank, others fell for it. Here are their responses: The name change wasn't the only April Fools' joke that tricked many. Here are some of the others that were doing the rounds. Audi name change Car manufacturer Audi released a statement on Monday via their Twitter account, in which they announced a change to the brand's name as well as their logo.

Taking to the comments, tweeps made it clear that they would not fall for  the April Fools' joke.
