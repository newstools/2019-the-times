"When you call the police and you say, 'Polisie, hulle is besig om die huis' - when they are breaking in ..." These were the words of Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane as he tried to address a crowd in Afrikaans. Maimane was with Western Cape premier candidate Alan Winde, health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo and chief whip John Steenhuisen during the DA's national police week campaign on Tuesday in Kleinvlei in Cape Town. The DA says it wants to take over policing in the Western Cape. Maimane addressed the crowd in Afrikaans and although it wasn't perfect, it seemed to strike a chord. "I only talk broken Afrikaans," Maimane admitted. "All that I know in Afrikaans is that people in the community are fed up!"
