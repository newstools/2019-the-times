"They need more than two gunmen - and need to shoot 40 armed guards first - to get to me." That was Nafiz Modack's response on WhatsApp to TimesLIVE on Tuesday after reports that he had been shot dead in Cape Town. According to a police incident report seen by TimesLIVE, the nightclub security boss died after being shot three times while viewing vehicles at a car auction in Bellville at 10.50am. The incident report said a 54-year-old woman was shot in the thigh. It said a white VW Polo stopped near Aucor and three men approached the man, named as Modack. "They started shooting at the deceased, hitting him once in the head and twice in the chest, also wounding a second person at the auction in the left thigh," said the report, adding that nine bullet casings were found at the scene. Asked to comment on the "Nafiz Modack shooting", Western Cape police spokesman Lt-Col Andr√® Traut said: "Kindly be advised that this office has no record of the incident you are referring to."
