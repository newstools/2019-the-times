Eastern Cape police say they are "very disappointed" in the behaviour of a female officer caught on camera severely attacking two women. In a video circulating on social media, the officer seems to be in a heated argument with two other women. She is then seen pushing them to the ground, and kicks and slaps one of them. The officer rolls up her sleeves and goes in for a second time, punching one of the women in the face. The incident happened in Tsolo, about 40km from Mthatha. It was not clear when it occurred, nor what led to the altercation. Provincial police spokesperson Capt Khaya Tonjeni said the officer has been identified as a reservist at the Tsolo police station. Preliminary disciplinary steps had been taken, and a case of assault with the intent to cause grievously bodily harm had been opened. Tonjeni said that the officer's behaviour was unacceptable and would not be tolerated. "South Africa Police Service members have a duty and responsibility to conduct themselves ethically and professionally both on duty and off duty. This is also the case with police reservists. "All who wear police uniform and are entrusted with duties of a police officer or reservistÂ  have a duty to conduct themselves in a professional manner," Tonjeni said.
