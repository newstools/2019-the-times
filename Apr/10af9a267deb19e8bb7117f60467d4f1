Durban will host its second Nedbank Cup final in three years after the Premier Soccer League (PSL) on Tuesday announced Moses Mabhida Stadium as the venue for this year’s edition. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza made the announcement and said that Bloemfontein was considered as the final venue by the executive committee but that it was not available. “It will therefore move to Moses Mabhida on May 18‚” revealed Khoza in a press conference at the league’s headquarters in Parktown‚ Johannesburg on Tuesday. Khoza also announced that the PSL end-of-the-season awards ceremony will also be hosted in Durban on May 18 – a week after the last fixture of the Absa Premiership. The last fixture is scheduled for May 11. Moses Mabhida was the venue when SuperSport United defeated Cape Town City on penalties in the 11th edition of the Nedbank Cup in 2017. It will also be the second time this season that the iconic 2010 World Cup venue hosts a final. The MTN8 final between SuperSport and City was staged at Moses Mabhida last year. The Durban stadium has hosted more cup finals than any other venue since 2009.
