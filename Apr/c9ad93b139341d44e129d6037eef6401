Instead of fancy high heels and a swanky dress, University of KwaZulu-Natal graduate Zandile Shange attended her graduation ceremony on Monday in traditional Zulu attire to pay tribute to her culture. In a video posted by the university that has gone viral, the social sciences graduate is seen performing a high-energy traditional dance before being capped - much to the delight of the crowd, who started ululating. The video has received nearly 145,000 views. Shange, 21, from Eshowe, told TimesLIVE that she decided to perform the dance because she is proud of her roots. "I could have gone in my heels and dress but I opted for traditional attire," she said. "I am proud of who I am: a Zulu woman." Shange grew up on a diet of maskandi music videos. "I love performing Zulu dances. I can do it every day. When I'm on my own, I play the music and just dance," she said. Women emerged as the majority among the 9,680 graduates receiving their degree certificates from UKZN. The university said it would be hosting 22 graduation ceremonies to award 5,510 undergraduate and 4,170 postgraduate degrees. The ceremonies kicked off on Monday and will continue for over a week.
