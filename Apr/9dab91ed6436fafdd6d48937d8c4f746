Three ministers are locked in a discussion with truck drivers at the Durban Central Police Station on Wednesday. Ministers of police Bheki Cele, home affairs Siyabonga Cwele and labour Mildred Oliphant are meeting with the representatives of the truck drivers federation. The meeting comes after recent volatile protests where some trucks were burnt and blocked along the KwaZulu-Natal N3 freeway, which affected thousands of motorists. The protest stemmed from the alleged hiring of foreign drivers in the transport industry. Journalists were initially allowed into the meeting but Cele's communication team later asked them to leave. A press conference is expected to be held after the meeting.
