Police say no arrests were made after some school pupils who handed over a memorandum at the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg went on a looting spree in the CBD and Hillbrow on Monday afternoon. Gauteng police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said there was a march by pupils under the banner of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) to Pixley ka Isaka Seme Street in the CBD to present a memorandum. “It is alleged that some of the marchers went to the shops and started looting in Hillbrow and the Johannesburg CBD. No arrests have been made and no injuries were reported,” Masondo said. Johannesburg metro police estimated earlier that around 3,000 pupils took part in the march. Their list of demands included calls for the department of education to upgrade infrastructure and safety at schools. Masondo said a number of shopkeepers had opened cases after the incident. Police opened cases of public violence.
