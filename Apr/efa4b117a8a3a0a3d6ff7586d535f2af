Valued at a staggering R93m, this has to be one of the most extravagant Easter eggs ever created. Rather than being made of run-of-the-mill chocolate, it's a diamond-encrusted work of art that doubles as a handbag. Reminiscent of the imperial Easter eggs Fabergé once made for Russian royals, it was created celebrity haute couture designer, Debbie Wingham, for a private American client. “This client has a lot of wonderful, luxurious things in her closet, things she said she would never wear again, so we decided to give them a new lease of life for Easter,” Wingham told the Daily Mail. On the Wendy Williams Show, Wingham explains that the bag is made from a real emu, which has been coated in blue diamond dust to strengthen it, as well as some of her client's 'outdated' accessories from last season. The egg is encased in an asymmetrical 24k gold, which was fashioned by Italian jeweller Alessandro Galanti. Rare pink and white diamonds adorn the exterior, the clasps are Cartier earrings that cost over half a million rand, and the inside is lined with a Hermès silk scarf. It's valued at $250k (about R93m), which makes it the most expensive handbag in the world. Wingham told the Daily Mail that the Easter egg-bag was named 'Reborn' as a nod to the upcycled nature of the materials used to create it. “I never thought I'd ever put 'upcycling' and 'world's most expensive' in the same sentence but here we are,”  she quipped.
