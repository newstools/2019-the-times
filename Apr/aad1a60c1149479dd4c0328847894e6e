More explosive testimony is expected to be heard as the state capture inquiry resumes on Tuesday. Patrick Mlambo, an investigator for the state capture inquiry, on Monday corroborated evidence by former Bosasa employee Richard le Roux, detailing various security upgrades that the company installed for former prisons boss Linda Mti. Le Roux previously testified that - apart from his normal duties in the company - he headed a special projects team that oversaw the installation of home security upgrades for high-profile politicians and state officials at the request of Bosasa boss Gavin Watson.
