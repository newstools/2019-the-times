The state needs to verify the identity of one of two people arrested this week in connection with the infamous hoax resurrection of Brighton "Elliot" Moyo by a self-proclaimed prophet. Nkululeko Dlamini, 35, and Silungisani Grace Sibanda, 40, appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. They face fraud charges in connection with theÂ  "resurrection video" flighted in February by pastor Alph Lukau's Alleluia Ministries International. They are believed to have been in contact with a mortuary for the "dead" man to be delivered in a coffin to the pastor to "resurrect". Prosecutor Mzamo Mathe told the court that the details contained in Dlamini's Zimbabwean passport and his SA identity document were not the same. "The facts on the accused's ID are inconsistent with his SA ID." He said the documents contained different names. "We are trying to make sense of the documents. We are asking for a postponement to understand what we are dealing with because we have someone who is in possession of two names," Mathe said. A lawyer representing Dlamini and Ncube agreed to the postponement for the same reasons given by the state. The two are due back in court on April 26 and will be detained at the Jeppe police holding cells. Mathe disclosed the state was in possession of a warrant of arrest for a third person. The state also indicated that it was ready to proceed to trial.
