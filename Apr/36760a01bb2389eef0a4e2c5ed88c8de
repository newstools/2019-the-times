A fire that broke out at the world-renowned Notre Dame cathedral has  ruined parts of the historical structure in Paris, France. Here is what we know so far: A fire on Monday caused the roof of the cathedral to collapse. The fire then spread to the spire and other parts of the building. What could have been the cause? Although the direct cause of the fire is not confirmed, the Parisian fire brigade said the fire may be linked to a renovation project on the spire of the cathedral, which included 250 tons of lead. Damages The fire destroyed the roof of the building as well as the spire and parts of the structure inside. Fire fighters were able to save most of the cathedral's valuable artwork. The bell towers and outside walls were also protected. Pledge to rebuild French president Emmanuel Macron visited the burning Cathedral and pledged that the country would rebuild the damaged historical site through a fund-raising campaign. Donations Two billionaires have pledged donations towards reconstructing the iconic cathedral. François-Henri Pinault, of Gucci and Christie's fame and also the husband of actress Salma Hayek, pledged to donate €100m early on. Rival luxury brand LVMH head Bernard Arnault followed with a €200m pledge.
