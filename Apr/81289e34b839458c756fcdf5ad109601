Supermarket group Spar is being investigated by the Competition Commission after banning SA-produced cigarettes, whose manufacturers are alleged to be tax dodgers, from its shops. The withdrawal is the latest battle in a war being waged between multinational cigarette manufacturers and South African producers, which is being fought through opposing industry groups the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa and the Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association.

Spar's spokesperson, Kerry Becker, said it would not comment while the commission was conducting its inquiry. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
