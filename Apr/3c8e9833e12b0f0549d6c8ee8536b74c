Horrifying CCTV footage of a couple on a motorbike being run over by a car in Bangalore, India, emerged on Monday. In the video, the couple is seen switching lanes as an SUV approaches. Unable to slow down, the SUV collides with the couple, pinning the woman under its front bumper, while the man gets wedged further in under the car. The occupants of the car then disembark to free the couple from under the car. The pair can then be seen limping away from the vehicle.
