An 18-year-old was among four suspects who appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday in connection with an apparent petrol station "hit" at the weekend in Cape Town. The baby-faced suspect, who turned 18 on April 3, appeared with Keagan van Rooi, 37, Ricardo de Kock, 35, and Jevon Voggenstein, 25, on murder charges. A 46-year-old man was shot multiple times at a Kenilworth petrol station in what police said was a gang-related killing on Saturday. The two younger men peered nervously from the gallery, looking for family members while the older men stood facing magistrate Goolam Bawa. Sources suggested that the shooting was possibly an act of revenge for the shooting of an alleged drug merchant in Athlone in March. The four suspects also face two charges of possession of firearms without a licence and a charge of possession of ammunition. The case was postponed until April 15 for the state to get outstanding bail information on the accused.
