An extramarital affair is behind the killing of a Phoenix mother and her two daughters at their home in 2018, according to an indictment lodged by the state. Collin Pillay, 45, stands accused of murdering Jane Govindsamy and her two daughters‚ Rackelle‚ 16‚ and Denisha‚ 22‚ in their Phoenix flat on September 21. Pillay made a brief appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday where he was indicted on three counts of murder and theft.

At the time of her death Jane was living in the house with her husband, Sagren. The Sunday Times reported that Pillay had a longstanding relationship with Jane‚ which Sagren Govindsamy has strongly denied. The indictment tells chilling details of how Pillay first killed Rackelle and Denisha, hid their bodies and waited for Jane to return home. A nine-day trial is expected to begin at the Durban High Court in July.
