Zahara has decided to air the dirty laundry of her relationship with TS Records and has accused them of "financially abusing" her since the release of her first album and she now plans to go the legal route. In 2015 the Loliwe hitmaker slammed reports that she wasn't getting her money but on Wednesday she told Mo Flava on Metro FM that she finally got the courage to take them on legally and is willing to make it public so others can learn from her situation. "If you remember when I came into the industry, my sister and my mother were trying to fight for my money... but I told them to keep quiet because I was scared," Zahara revealed on Metro FM. Sowetan yesterday reported that the singer made allegations against TS Records executives TK Nciza and Sbu Leope, claiming she was underpaid for her performances, the sale of her records, and royalties for when her songs were played. Zahara said she was initially scared to speak out as she would be treated as an outcast. She became emotional as she spoke out abut surviving on money from Samro and only getting money every other month from TS Records. "I didn't know that I was damaging myself... because why would I go and work and then have to beg for my money... which was sometimes a mere R10,000. Why would I go work and have to plea for that R10,000 that I need to ask for months on end? I'm not dumb, my family also knew about all this. I was at the point where I was dependent on Samro money, that comes quarterly," she said before taking a moment to compose herself. Several attempts by TshisaLIVE to get comment from TK Nciza on behalf of TS Records were unsuccessful by the time of publishing. However, speaking to Sowetan, TK denied all the allegations made by Zahara and said he heard figures of "R10m and R30m being bandied about in the media", which he thought were outrageous. "She needs prayers. I've not worked with her for three years," TK said. Listen to the rest of the interview below.
