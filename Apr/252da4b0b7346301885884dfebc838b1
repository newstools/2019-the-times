Seven teenagers implicated in the killing of Polokwane musician Thorisho Themane were on Wednesday granted R2,000 bail each - with the proviso they move away from the city and do not return to their schools. Limpopo police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the teens appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Ngoepe said the case had been postponed to May 31 to allow for further police investigations. Themane died two months ago after being beaten by an alleged teen gang in Flora Park.Â The incident went viral after two videos showing the badly beaten Themane lying on the ground were shared on social media platforms. In the background, his attackers could be heard telling him he would die. Local newspaper the Polokwane Review reports that the bail conditions for the teenagers state that they must relocate from the municipal area of the city and that they may not attend any of the schools they attended at the beginning of the year.
