The Taste & Tell series is a monthly feature where the same or similar supermarket items are put to a blind taste test by a panel. (This one was made up of members of the SA Cake Decoratorâ€™s Guild.) We bought traditional and non-traditional hot cross buns from five big retailers and asked our tasters to score them according to various criteria such as taste, appearance (including the cross on each bun), aroma, and whether or not they'd buy the product. To ensure the tasting was fair, the products were stripped of their packaging and numbered under the watchful eye of food expert Jenny Kay before being served to the panel. Auditor Mellicent Mashell oversaw the process and collated the scores. It's important to remember that taste is subjective and what is good for one may not be good for another. 6 Traditional Hot Cross Buns Price: R24.99 less R5.46 for two What the judges said: 6 Hot Cross Buns Traditional Price: R16.99 per pack or 2 packs for R30 What the judges said: Freshline 6 Hot Cross Buns Price: R21.99 What the judges said: The Bakery Traditional Hot Cross Buns Price: R14.99 for six What the judges said: 6 Traditional Hot Cross Buns Price: R17.99 per pack less 20% for two What the judges said: Hot Cross Buns, Chocolate Price: R18.99 for six What the judges said: Freshline, Caramel & Chocolate Flavour Hot Cross Buns Price: R21.99 - R24.99 for six What the judges said: 6 Chocolate & Caramel Hot Cross Buns Price: R22.99 for six, less 20% for 2 packs What the judges said: 6 Chocolate Hot Cross Buns Price: R29.99 less R5.42 for 2 packs What the judges said: Chocolate Hot Cross Buns with Frey chocolate chips Price: R19.99 for six What the judges said:
