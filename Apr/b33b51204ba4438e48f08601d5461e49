Samu Kerevi continued his sparkling Super Rugby season for the Reds as he inspired them to a 21-14 away win over the Sharks on Friday. It was a fourth victory of the season for the Reds, who had lost five of eight previous games, and their first triumph in Durban in 15 years. Kerevi set up two of the three tries with his strong carries and ability to break the line as Bryce Hegarty, Chris Feauai-Sautia and Tate McDermott also scored. Hegarty added two conversions and Hamish Stewart the other. It was a second disappointing home loss for the Sharks, who were beaten 51-17 by the Jaguares last week and have now also lost five out of nine matches this season. They had 15 handling errors in a performance dominated by mistakes, allowing the Reds to open up a 14-0 lead in the opening 20 minutes. Flyhalf Hegarty broke through a massive gap in defence to touch down and put the Reds on the scoreboard after just two minutes. Kerevi, the 25-year-old Fiji-born Australian international, popped up a pass for Feauai-Sautia to score but the Sharks would have had hopes of a comeback as they went into the break only 14-7 behind after scoring their try in the 25th minute. Hooker Kerron van Vuuren crossed over in a rolling maul after the Sharks had turned down a number of kickable penalties to finally register some points. Handling errors then cost the home side with two breakaway opportunities wasted before halftime and errors continuing thereafter. In the 60th minute, it was another move set up by Kerevi's strength that allowed scrumhalf McDermott to go over for a third try for the Reds and restore their 14-point advantage. Jean-Luc du Preez pealed off a strong scrum and powered over for a try in the last minute to restore some home pride but the effort came too late. "It was a massive effort from our boys today. Our mindset all week was switched on," said Kerevi.
