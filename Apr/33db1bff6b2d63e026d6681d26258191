A man walks into an Eastern Cape post office and shakes hands with the armed security guard, to whom he introduces himself as a police investigator. It sounds like the start of a joke doesn't it? But it wasn't funny because before long, the guard and the rest of the post office team, plus a few customers were locked up in an office, trussed up with cable ties. The robbery took place at the Elliott post office about 4.30pm on Monday. In a statement, the police explained how the robbery went down: "Three unknown males entered the post office and went to the two security guards. One introduced himself as a police investigator and shook the hand of the guard who was carrying the firearm. "While the guard was shaking the suspect's hand, the second suspect grabbed the security officer's firearm and ordered them into managerâ€™s office." Three customers were also forced into the office. The security guards and cashiers were bound with cable ties. "One of the cashiers was told to pack the cash into a bag. "The suspects then left with an undisclosed amount of money. No shots were fired and nobody was hurt." Police are appealing to the community for help in tracing the suspects.
