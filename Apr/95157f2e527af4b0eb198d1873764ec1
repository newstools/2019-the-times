Police have yet to make an arrest after a 19-year-old male accused of theft was sjambokked and stoned to death by a mob, in Dlamini Extension two, Soweto. "According to information at our disposal, the boy allegedly robbed a pedestrian of her cellphone. The lady screamed and community members chased and caught him," said police spokesperson Capt Mpande Khoza. "They then assaulted him with all sorts of things including sjamboks and stones. We have not made any arrest as yet."  The beating took place on Thursday. Police issued a warning to community members not to take the law into their own  hands. "We strongly advise against taking the law into your hands. Whenever a community member spots any wrongdoing, they must report or hand it over to the police," said Khoza. Those who took the law into their own hands could end up becoming suspects in serious crimes. A case of murder is being investigated, he confirmed.
