Hout Bay residents were startled on Monday morning as gunshots ripped through the coastal suburb. Four people were shot dead and two others were injured in the shootout. Hout Bay community policing forum (CPF) chairman Anthony Chemaly said the shooting was allegedly between two rival organisations over a disputed taxi route. â€œThe route has been disputed since the MyCiti buses have been running. That has been building for some time," said Chemaly. This is what we know about the shootout so far.
