And where the president goes, headlines follow. Here's a wrap of his campaign efforts this week. OR Tambo School of Leadership On Thursday Ramaphosa delivered a keynote speech at the launch of the ruling party's leadership school, named after Oliver Tambo. Other party members who were at the launch included former president Jacob Zuma, Ace Magashule, Thoko Didiza and Paul Mashatile.

In his address there he touched on job creation and the scourge of abuse. New trains in Cape Town Ramaphosa was in Cape Town on Tuesday with premier Helen Zille to launch new trains. Joined by transport minister Blade Nzimande, Ramaphosa said the move was necessary as it would ensure that train delays become a thing of the past.
