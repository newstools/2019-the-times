Three people are expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Monday after they were arrested for a triple murder in Hanover Park, Cape Town. The arrests followed the discovery of the bodies of three people with gunshot wounds in a car in the early hours of Friday morning. The two suspects are aged 22 and 44, while the woman is 32 years old. Police spokesperson sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the trio were arrested the same day. They face charges of murder.
