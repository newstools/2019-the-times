CCTV footage of the rescue has gone viral on social media as Thosago, who is a cleaner at the gym inÂ  Craighall Park, didn't hesitate when he noticed someone was in trouble. "I was so scared, very scared. I've never seen something like that. I just thought if I don't jump in, then this person can die in a matter of seconds," Thosago told News24.
