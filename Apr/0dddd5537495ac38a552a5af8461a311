Rumours have surfaced again that VW may introduce a 300kW super Golf that comprehensively outmuscles the range’s current performance king, the 228kW Golf R. It would give VW a car to take on the likes of the Audi RS3 and Mercedes-AMG A45 in the compact high-performance league. Autocar magazine claims that a Golf R Plus derivative based on the next-generation Golf, which is expected to be revealed later this year, has the backing of VW CEO Herbert Diess. “We're looking at introducing a new ‘halo’ performance model that would offer a level of performance beyond that of the next Golf R,” a VW insider reportedly told Autocar, alleging that this model will be the “most extreme and powerful Golf yet”. Power would most likely come from a seriously tweaked version of VW’s existing 2l four-cylinder turbo engine, which is already used in the Golf R and GTI, with 4Motion all-wheel drive to lay it down. The first whiff of the project was in 2014 when the covers came off a Golf R 400 concept car (the 400 refers to the car’s horsepower, or 300kW), but VW decided against putting it into production at the time.
