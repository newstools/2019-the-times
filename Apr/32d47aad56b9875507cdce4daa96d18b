Fans of Date My Family were ready to kick their TVs in on Sunday when one of the contestant's friends made comments that had the internet in mob mode. Blessing was part of a group that were interrogating bachelor Floyd, but ended up dominating conversations about the show when he flexed about his lifestyle. Dude seemed more interested in partying and slay queens than anything else. He even suggested that if you ain't part of the club's regulars list, then you're bored with your life - and broke! It was too much for some, who flooded social media with memes and messages dragging him. They even brought his nose into it, labelling a fight he was having with Floyd as the Game of Noses".
