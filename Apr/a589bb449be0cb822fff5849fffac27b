Writer, editor and music selector Zodwa Kumalo hates it when the occupants in her car ask her to turn the music down. She's created a playlist called lonely hearts club – to be played, unapologetically, at top volume, on the open road when you're on a solo road trip. Writer Yolisa Mkele believes that when you're around people you have to pander a little. "Just like Mmusi Maimane's accent, your sound has to change to suit the crowd," he says. "If you’re lucky though at some point during the road trip everyone goes to sleep and you get to play stuff that’s actually cool ... that's when you put this playlist on." Motoring writer Thomas Falkiner favours music made with real instruments. Rock. Indie. Heck, even a little country will get his eyebrows curling in appreciation. As such these are the 10 songs he sees fitting for that journey that’s always better than the actual destination. Editorial assistant Zola Zingithwa’s taste in music depends on her mood — she listens to everything except drum and bass. That said, a playlist that allows her to sing along with no cares in the world is always a winner. As her playlist shows, editorial assistant Thabile Mokone makes no apologies about loving trendy 'bubblegum' music that's super relatable.
