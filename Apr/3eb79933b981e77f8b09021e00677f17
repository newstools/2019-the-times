Former head of the KwaZulu-Natal Hawks Gen Johan Booysen is to testify at the state capture inquiry on Wednesday. He'll be the second witness to testify about corruption and maladministration within SA's law enforcement agencies. On Tuesday, former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride claimed that former top cop Khomotso Phahlane orchestrated a counter-investigation into the police watchdog to thwart a corruption probe linked to him. Testifying at the inquiry, McBride pulled no punches when he gave evidence on the now-suspended police commissioner and the controversial "Mabula team" - a crack group of officers from the North West tasked to investigate Ipid officials, private investigator Paul O'Sullivan and his attorney Sarah-Jane Trent.
