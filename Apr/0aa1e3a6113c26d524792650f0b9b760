One person has been critically injured after he was ejected from a car while travelling on the N3. According to Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson, the single-vehicle accident has caused aÂ  major traffic backlog on the N3 near the Brickfield Road turn-off, Durban bound. "It is believed that the single vehicle somehow lost control and rolled numerous times, ejecting the passenger," said Jamieson. "The passenger has sustained critical injuries and is currently being stabilised by advanced life-support paramedics on the scene." Jamieson has cautioned motorists to avoid the area  while emergency personnel work to clear the scene. Only two lanes are currently open.
