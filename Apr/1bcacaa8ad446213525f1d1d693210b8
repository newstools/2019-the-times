It's only four months into the year and Mzansi has already faced several down times with the loss of much-loved stars. Mzansi mourned the life and talent of young Matwetwe star, Sibusiso Khwinana after it was confirmed he was stabbed to death in March 2019. The young star and a friend were allegedly attacked over a cellphone. SAPS spokesperson Captain Mavelo Masondo confirmed the 25-year-old man had been fatally stabbed at around 11 pm in Pretoria. Veteran jazz musician Dorothy Masuka died at the age of 83. Dorothy had been suffering from complications related to hypertension after suffering a mild stroke last year. "She was in the comfort of her home surrounded by her children and grandchildren," said family spokesperson Fortune Hute. Hute said that Masuka would be remembered for staying true to herself and her craft. Those close to Durban-based comedian Sibusiso "Ankel" Shangase were left devastated by his death due to a longterm illness earlier this year. At just 30-years-old Ankel was known for his comedy, Mcing, for cameos on Uzalo and for his larger than life personality.  After being in and out of hospital, the star was admitted into a care facility in November last year. Veteran jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi died on the same day that Bra Hugh Masekela had died the year before. Oliver's record label Gallo Records confirmed the news and Mzansi sent love to the icon's family. His music lives on. On January 5, South African music lovers were dealt a heavy blow as they heard of the passing of iconic musician Dan Tshanda. Tshanda was the driving force behind the careers of artists including Dalom Kids and Splash. He influenced many musicians with his brand of upbeat traditional music.
