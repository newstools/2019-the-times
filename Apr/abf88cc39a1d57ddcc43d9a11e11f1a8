A Durban security boss paid to protect IFP heavyweights at their election manifesto launch – including party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi – has himself been accused of falling foul of the law. Times Select can reveal Quenton Morgandran Chetty, of Pinetown Protection Services (PPS), found himself in handcuffs last December when he was arrested in a police sting relating to illegal guns and interception of police radio broadcasts. He was released and never charged. Chetty denied he had been arrested, insisting he’d had no part in any impropriety, while the IFP confirmed PPS had been hired for protection for senior party members, but was unaware of “any allegations of unlawful behaviour” by Chetty.
