President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged residents of Ivory Park in Johannesburg to vote for the ANC so that it can fix their problems. Speaking at rally on Thursday afternoon, Ramaphosa said he had heard residents' cries about crime, joblessness, water cuts and lack of housing. "We have heard you, we are going to fix things," said Ramaphosa. He said police minister, Bheki Cele would visit the township to deal with its problems with crime. "We can't allow our people to walk the streets in fear because of criminals," said Ramaphosa. He said police should be trained to also deal with the problem of gender-based violence and rape. "Rape for women is almost a death sentence, it affects them for the rest of their lives. Let us treat our women folk with respect," said Ramaphosa. He said men should "lock your pants" . Ramaphosa said he had also heard complaints from parents about their unemployed graduate children and would work to create jobs. Part of the job creation would include investment in township economies, he said. He said it was time that black South Africans owned the economy and not just their white counterparts. Ramaphosa said the hardships because of corruption of the past few years would end. "Those who have done wrong must know they will face prosecution," he said.
