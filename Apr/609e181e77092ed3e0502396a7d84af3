Kabomo has added his voice to the outrage over fake pastors who have duped congregants, explaining that he doesn't believe God would ever command a pastor to buy a flashy car or jet when his congregation's struggling. Several pastors have made headlines recently for everything from accusations of sexual assault to showing off their flashy lifestyle. Kabomo who is evidently gatvol of pastors ripping off their congregants took to Instagram this week to share his thoughts on the matter. "I will never believe God told a pastor to buy himself a Lambo or a private jet when there are poor people in his congregation," he wrote. Kabomo's post was shared by several of his followers who echoed his sentiments. The musician has always been outspoken on the subject and also tweeted that pastors splurging on flashy things cannot be God's work. "No! It's not cool that your pastor is rolling in a private jet and a Rolls Royce when his congregation can barely make rent. That's not God."
