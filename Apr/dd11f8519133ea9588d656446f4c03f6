A healthy baby rhino has been born to poaching survivor Thandi at a nature reserve in the Eastern Cape. It is her third calf. The Kariega reserve said on Thursday its field guides spotted the new male white rhino calf on Wednesday. Thandi had separated from her other two calves, Thembi (born in 2015), and Colin (born in 2017) and moved into the thick bush. "When she emerged on Wednesday, she was followed by a tiny baby. "This was the first sighting of Thandi and her new little calf after its birth," the reserve said. Thandi is a rare survivor of a brutal poaching incident in 2012. She was saved by wildlife vet Dr William Fowlds after being found in a pool of blood. It is the second reason to celebrate within 24 hours for Fowlds. On Wednesday, he commended the 25-year prison terms meted out to the notorious Ndlovu poaching gang by the Grahamstown High Court. They were convicted of about 55 criminal counts involving the poaching of 13 rhinos over four years in the province. Fowlds recalled two of their victims. A male rhino called Pride managed to survive the attack but his companion, a female named Justice, did not survive the ordeal.
