Their rhythm might be debatable, but they are never shy to hit the stage. Here's five political leaders who have shown us their skills.President Cyril Ramaphosa showed us his attempt at the Gwara Gwara at an ANC rally in March. EFF leader Julius Malema busted a few moves and took a shot at the vosho at the party's gala dinner in February.
