Hip-hop rivals Cassper Nyovest and AKA once again found themselves on the Twitter trends list after a series of petty posts - and it all started with a watermelon emoji. US music mogul Diddy probably didn't think that when he posted a tweet with a simple watermelon emoji he would send SA Twitter into ICU mode. The post was meant to be a teaser for an upcoming flavour of Ciroc vodka, but grootman should have known that just the mention of watermelon on the Mzansi Twitter streets will spark a fierce war of words between AKA and Cassper stans. You see, Cassper is a Ciroc ambassador and AKA released his own brand of Cruz vodka in, wait for it, watermelon flavour! So fans have been fighting not only about their music but also on which of their alcohol brands are better. When fans saw that Diddy was joining the watermelon wave which AKA has been riding, they suggested it was a defeat for Cass and he should just take the L and move on. Besides the name of both rappers trending, Ciroc and #EverybodyLovesWatermelon also made it to the most talked about list on Twitter. Even the likes of Tresor and L-Tido joined in the fun, tagging Cassper in Diddy's teasers. Cassper was not amused by Diddy's tweets and immediately responded to it by putting a stop-sign emoji. AKA saw the opportunity to rev up the petty meter and shot off several posts to Diddy telling him what a fan he was. Cassper later claimed that it was a win for him and the free publicity would see him come out smiling. Dude even tried to counter the wave with his own hashtag punting Ciroc. But AKA just laughed it off and hit the internet with a simple: "Imagine beefing with a fruit".
