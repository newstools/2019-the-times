Four would-be farmers in the Western Cape are in hot water for allegedly duping the government into giving them two farms worth R8.6m under the land redistribution scheme. Ralph Damonse, 57, Isak Saal, 48, Reginald le Fleur, 62, and Manuel Cohen, 66, are facing fraud and money laundering charges in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Bellville. The government apparently learnt the hard way that its generosity had been abusedÂ  when it turned out the prospective farmers had already sold portions of a Vredendal farm before acquiring it. The enterprising farmers then allegedly used money from the fraudulent sale as surety to secure the grant. Several people unwittingly became beneficiaries in the lucrative scheme when the four alleged fraudsters provided their names to the department of rural development and land reform in order to meet the requirements. The four will be back in the court on May 24 to allow the Hawks to complete their investigation. Hawks spokesperson Capt Philani Nkwalase said: "The two farms, one worth R3m located in Vredendal and another valued at R5.6m in St Helena Bay, were granted to the suspects as part of the government programme to correct past imbalances. "The suspects allegedly sold for R3m a portion of the St Helena farm which they acquired through the land redistribution for agricultural development grant."
