It took a team effort, coaxing and a ceiling hook from the fire department to rescue a dog that found itself trapped under an enormous boulder after a dassie chase went wrong in Simon’s Town. A rescue operation was set in motion after a resident, not knowing who else to call for help, called Cape Medical Response on Wednesday asking for assistance with the hound wedged tightly under rocks. "Upon arrival, the dog, Simon, was found about three metres deep under a very large boulder. He had been chasing a dassie when he wiggled himself into the crevice and was not able to free himself," said Cape Medical Response in a post on Facebook. Darren Zimmerman of Cape Medical Response requested assistance from the NSRI in Simon's Town, fire and rescue, TEARS Animal Rescue and the Cape of Good Hope SPCA. "Simon was able to be hooked by his collar to bring him closer to the responders using a ceiling hook from the fire department and a dog-catching device from the SPCA. They managed to manoeuvre Simon out of his entrapment,” said the organisation. The dog, which was trapped for about an hour, emerged safely.
