Finance minister Tito Mboweni says he has read the book by investigative journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh titled Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule's Web of Capture, which was released on March 31. He said he had made a decision not to publicly share his views on the book's contents because of the legal implications. On social media people said that Mboweni's response was a sign of truth being evident in the book, while others said that he's trying to have his cake and eat it. In a post that has since been deleted, Mboweni criticised the book's title, describing it as "disappointing". "I must say that from a conceptual and intellectual viewpoint, I find books which force me to agree with the author's conclusion a priori very disappointing. Tell the story and let me conclude in my own understanding of the facts."
