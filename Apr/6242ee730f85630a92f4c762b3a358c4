A-listers came out in droves to celebrate the 15th anniversary of pop culture channel E! Africa in Sandton on Thursday night. Here's a look at who sparkled and who needs to polish up their look: After a bit of a bumpy start, Nomzamo has become an unstoppable fashion machine. We loved her feathered top which — uncharacteristically — kept her chest out of sight. As usual she kept her hair simple, but chic. Queen B almost always gets it right. Bonang looked sexy and classy in this sheer nude dress from Villioti Fashion Institute. The peek-a-boo effect created by the beading was simply stunning. This dress wasn't particularly fashion-forward, but Jessica's curves worked it in all the right places making for a beautiful silhouette. DJ Sabby was by far the best-dressed man on the night. Simple, sleek and dashing — the black ensemble with minimal accessories had us swooning. Sigh. Oh no, Minnie. The gloves, the multi-coloured bejewelled belt ... what was going on here?  The celeb's take on Marilyn Monroe was easily the most shocking (pink) look from the ladies on the night. Lasizwe loves attention. We get it. But last night the assault on our eyes was just too much. His baby grow and blazer ensemble left us feeling empty inside. We love Somizi and Mohale, but we hate whoever styled them for this event. Somizi's torn jeans looked out of place in a room full of suits, and Mohale looked like he was on his way to a daytime business meeting. We wanted to love this look, but unfortunately the poor fit of this sparkling jumpsuit left Roxy looking like a disco queen gone wrong. • This article adapted from one originally published in the S Mag section of the SowetanLIVE website.
