Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba was criticised by many on social media after being rejected by residents when he visited Alexandra township on Monday. Following service delivery protests in Alex that started two weeks ago, residents have been demanding Mashaba address them and attend to their grievances. On Monday night, Mashaba met Alex residents as part of the Integrated Development Plan. The mayor was heckled and blocked from addressing the residents by disrupters at the Malboro Community Centre. Mashaba blamed the disruptions on the ANC, saying the ruling party was using "poor and vulnerable" residents. The DA and the ANC have been pointing fingers at each other regarding the lack of service delivery in Alex. In a statement, the mayor accused the ANC of "generating political protests" in the city. Service delivery protests also broke out in Soweto and Kagiso last week. Mashaba was criticised by some on social media for pinning the disruptions on the ANC and not dealing with the  issues raised by Alex residents. Others felt that the residents should have given the mayor the opportunity to address them.
