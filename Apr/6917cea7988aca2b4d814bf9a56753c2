An attempt to evict illegal squatters resulted in violent protest on Wednesday at Rust Ter Vaal in Vereeniging. Two people have been confirmed dead, according to SAPS spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo. Three others have been taken to hospital. A member of the Red Ants, a security agency used to handle evictions, is one of the people killed, according to the Crime Air Network. Masondo said the Red Ants and the sheriff of the court were acting on a court order to remove shacks which were illegally erected. "It is alleged that, as the Red Ants were demolishing the shacks, a fight broke out with members of the community," he said. Murder and attempted murder cases have been opened.

The municipality said in a statement it had obtained a court order for the eviction. The land invasions had begun in recent weeks, and the local government approached the courts because it became necessary to "curb the mushrooming of structures on the land". The R82, an arterial road linking Vereeniging with Johannesburg, was closed due to the public unrest, the municipality said. A heavy presence of law enforcement is in the area and investigations are under way into the circumstances that led to the fatalities, said the Emfuleni statement. The municipality offered its condolences to the families of those who were killed, adding it would also open its own probe into the morning's events. This is a developing story.
