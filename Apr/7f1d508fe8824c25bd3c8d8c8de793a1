Community members from the Amaoti area, north of Durban, gathered outside the Verulam Magistrate's court on Monday where a man, arrested in connection with the death of a 1-year-old boy, was expected to appear. The 31-year-old man was arrested in the Eastern Cape on Friday after the  boy’s body was found in an open grassy area at the end of a cul de sac in  Phoenix last week Tuesday. The boy had been reported missing from the Amaoti area near Phoenix a few days before his body was found. A missing person's report was opened at Inanda police station. Community members gathered holding placards calling for justice to be served for the little boy. Amaoti councillor Bongani Qhantsi  said  the community did not want the man to get bail. "The community is very angered by the nature of the crime and the animalistic way that boy was killed," said Qhantsi. The suspect  is expected to make his first appearance on Monday.
