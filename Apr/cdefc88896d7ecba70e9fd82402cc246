Radio 2000 on Friday announced its line-up changes and one of the biggest additions is radio veteran, Phat Joe. The presenter, who has had his fair share of controversies, started his new gig on Monday. Soon enough, his name went to the top of the trends board, with some praising the station's decision.Â Many immediately said they would be jumping ship and ditching their currents faves for Joe. It wasn't all positive feedback. Some people wanted their old squad back while other's had a few suggestions for the SABC. Love him or hate him, he got people talking on day one.
