Former president Jacob Zuma on Sunday once again attempted to dispel the "nine wasted years" narrative claiming that there was policy certainty under his administration. In a statement embedded in his Twitter account, Zuma said all the policies he implemented during his nine years at the Union Buildings was a result of consultation within the ANC and parliament. He said the "narrative by a few individuals in the leadership" who claimed that there was policy uncertainty during his reign was "dishonest". Wrote Zuma: "Nothing could be further from the truth." According to Zuma, his government's policy was directed by what was resolved at ANC policy conferences and national conferences. Moreover, he said, all of his government's policies were scrutinised by parliament and various interest groups as espoused by the country's constitution. "It is important to emphasise therefore, that government policy is not the exclusive preserve of the head of the executive. It is often contested at every step of the way by public representatives in Parliament and also by various interest groups," he wrote. "The head of the executive does not dictate policy but articulates and champions the policies of the governing party. "The policy development process is transparent and comprehensive. Towards the five-yearly [ANC] Policy Conference the policy discussion documents are sent to the branches for a thorough discussion, and are also made available to the broader public for comments."
