Fam. R Kelly is broke! Not like "I have money for transport only" broke, but literally broke AF, and the internet is kissing karma on the cheek to thank her! Daily Mail reported that R. Kelly has -$13 in his bank account after $150,000 was seized when his former Chicago landlord filed a lawsuit accusing him of owing back rent. While having -$13 is sad news for anybody, and especially for R. Kelly who probably hasn't seen such an amount on his statement since he was a teen, the internet was in full rejoice mode. R Kelly's ouchea wishing that Jesus would save him, again, as everything seems to be crumbling down around him. Like, literally, karma is chilling on his doorstep sippin' on some hot tea! The 52-year-old pleaded not guilty in February to charges that he sexually assaulted three teenage girls and a fourth woman. This came in the wake of the Lifetime television documentary, Surviving R Kelly, which saw seven women including his ex-wife accuse him of emotional and sexual abuse. No matter how bad a day you are having today, you can't possibly be having one as bad a Kells, fam. And besides, did you ever - like once in your life - imagine having a bank balance fatter than R Kelly's? Probably not, so yeah have a glorious day, mntase!
