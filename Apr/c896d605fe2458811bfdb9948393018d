The man accused of murdering Irish aid worker John Curran in Cape Town last November was denied bail on Tuesday. Mitspa Onyoka, 24, allegedly stabbed and killed Curran, 60, in his city-centre apartment on November 7 2018. Onyoka was seen in lift surveillance footage coming out of Curran's building on Buitengracht Street. He is also accused of stealing the Irishman's phone and other belongings. At the time of his murder, Curran was on holiday after completing a two-year directorship with Mellon Education in Cape Town, an NGO providing aid to under-resourced schools. Onyoka, a Congolese citizen, was arrested two weeks later on Voortrekker Road in Cape Town, where he worked as a cleaner. Legal aid was provided to Onyoka for his first court appearance on March 12 but he fired the attorney before the bail application. He then appointed attorney Anthony Berinato for his March 22 bail application, but at that appearance the French interpreter failed to turn up, leading to a postponement. On Tuesday the interpreter arrived late, but Berinato proceeded with the bail hearing anyway. "I did not feel it was needed today â€¦ We were able to continue with the bail application without him," Berinato told TimesLIVE. Onyoka will appear in court again on May 16. The investigation into Curran's murder continues.
