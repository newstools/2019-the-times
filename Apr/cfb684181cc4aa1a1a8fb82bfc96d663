EFF leader Julius Malema described his first-ever experience on a Metro Rail train as an "experience and a half‚Äù while on the campaign trail in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. Malema joined thousands of commuters just after 6am on their way to work from Umlazi to the Durban city centre. PODCAST: The Numbers Don't Lie - Is the IFP coming back?

The nearly 45-minute train ride saw scores of commuters taking selfies with Malema and telling him about their day-to-day travel woes, while EFF supporters chanted struggle songs the whole way. "Our people are subjected to overcrowded trains and as a result they are arriving very late to work and school. Those are the issues we need to fix," he said. With less than three weeks to go until the national elections, Malema has been on the campaign trail in KwaZulu-Natal. He is expected to address students at the Durban University of Technology later on Tuesday. On Monday Malema and former president Jacob Zuma were both in northern KZN on the campaign trail for their respective parties.
