ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula insists the party had no knowledge of Andile Ramaphosa's dealings with African Global Operations, formerly known as Bosasa. He was speaking during an interview on Radio 702's Eusebius McKaiser show. McKaiser has been hosting political leaders from numerous parties ahead of the May 8 elections. During the interview with Mbalula, a caller asked why the party should receive votes despite the ANC's alleged connections to looting and state capture. Mbalula said the ANC was on the mend and denied any knowledge of business dealings between African Global Operations and Blue Crane Capital, a company owned by Andile Ramaphosa. "We have never known about him up until now when his father became the president. Of course all that has ramifications but I presume that Andile Ramaphosa, among others, has been in business in his own right over the years." The Ramaphosas have been making news headlines over reports that AndileÂ  benefited from business dealings with Bosasa were made public during the state capture commission. Giving his side of the story, Andile Ramaphosa said working with the company was a "severe oversight" on his end, but denied receiving bribes.
