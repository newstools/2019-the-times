The defence force last week suspended 35 soldiers after they went AWOL (absent without leave) in Cuba for over a month while they were on a course in the Caribbean nation. "These members were sent to Cuba in 2018 to study medicine and have been AWOL since February 2019," said SANDF spokesperson Brig-Gen Mafi Mgobozi.Â "The Military Command Council wants to state emphatically that the SANDF will not tolerate any ill-discipline within the SANDF and drastic action will be taken against any member of the SANDF who brings the defence force into disrepute." Defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said during her defence budget vote speech on May 18 last year that there were 202 SANDF students training to become doctors in Cuba.
