Two men died when a fire  raged through numerous shacks at the Cato Crest informal settlement at the weekend, said KwaZulu-Natal police. Capt Thulani Zwane said the charred remains of the two men were found in the rubble. He told TimesLIVE that it has since been established that the two were aged 30 and 33. It was not immediately clear whether they had been in the same shack. "The cause of the fire is yet to be known," Zwane added.
