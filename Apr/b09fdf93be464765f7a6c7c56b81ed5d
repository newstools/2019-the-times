A day after 18 schoolchildren were injured in a taxi crash in Durban, another minibus taxi was involved in an accident in which mainly children were hurt. Robert McKenzie, KZN Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, said a taxi transporting children home from school on Tuesday had crashed into a car on the Inanda Highway, outside Durban. "The crash involved a minibus and a light motor vehicle. A total of 24 people have been injured including many schoolchildren." McKenzie said the cause of the accident was being investigated by police.
