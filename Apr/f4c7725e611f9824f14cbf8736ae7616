Nigeria's minister of agriculture claims that wealthy Nigerians are ordering pizza from the UK and having it flown in on British Airways flights.Daily Mail reported that minister Audu Ogbeh made the claim during a senate agricultural committee meeting while trying to emphasise that the country spends too much money on foreign imports. “Do you know, sir, that there are Nigerians who use their cellphones to import pizza from London; they buy in London and bring it in on British Airways in the morning to pick up at the airport,"  The Cable quoted him as saying. The minister also said said the country's farming is not doing well because vegetables are imported from South Africa. British Airways did not respond to the claims.
