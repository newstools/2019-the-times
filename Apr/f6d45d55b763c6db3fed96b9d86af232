More than a decade after last donning the green jacket and being considered 'done,' Tiger Woods has made an epic comeback, winning the Masters at Augusta National. This is his 15th major and his 5th Masters title, the makings of which nobody thought possible. Not only because of an 11-year drought, but because he fought back from behind 54 holes, reports The Guardian. Woods fired a final-round two-under par 70 to finish on 13-under 275 for a one-shot victory to capture the green jacket. An all-American trio of three-time major winner Brooks Koepka, world number two Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele shared second on 276. Woods underwent a spinal fusion in 2017 after suffering from chronic back pain, which made his career comeback even more unlikely. His historic win and powerful comeback have seen the golfer jump straight to the global trends board. Fans and foes have applauded the golfer for beating the odds and rising up to take the victory despite his personal strife, health issues and career lows. Pundits have called the victory the 'most unlikely win' and have credited Woods for remaining calm and steadfast at Augusta, taking him to ultimate victory. The joy on Woods's face was undeniable, as he lifted his cap from his head, realising that the long-awaited redemption was his. Here's a snapshot of some of the reaction. Additional reporting AFP
