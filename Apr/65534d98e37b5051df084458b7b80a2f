A truck trailer carrying 75 pigs rolled on the Long Tom pass between Lydenburg and Sabie in Mpumalanga, sending the animals into a frenzy. According to SA Trucker, the incident happened on Wednesday when the driver of the truck lost control as he rounded a sharp curve. "He [the driver] managed to avoid an accident but the trailer, loaded with 75 pigs, toppled over. There were also 70 pigs aboard the truck," SA Trucker wrote on its website. One pig was injured in the accident when its trotter got squashed as the trailer rolled, the website said. It said the truck was on its way to an abattoir in White River near Nelspruit. "The animals had to be contained in makeshift cages which were built with mesh screens taken from the truck. Some of the pigs were found a kilometre from the accident scene," the website said. According to the website, three of the pigs were unaccounted for and could have been stolen.
