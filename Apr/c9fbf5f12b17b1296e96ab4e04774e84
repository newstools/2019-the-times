Cassper Nyovest left his fans wondering what went wrong when he shared a very cryptic tweet about repeating mistakes and how it messed him up when he realised what he had done. "Nothing will make you feel dumber than repeating the same mistakes. Arrrrrrgh! I'm so hacked!" he tweeted. Cassper has been using his TL to spread the message of self-love, positivity and all things flex and humbleness (the last two are a bit of a weird mix, but Tsibipians have been latching on to his every word so... *insert shrug*) So his people flooded his comment section with encouraging messages in return. Telling him to just learn from that mistake and be alert enough not to repeat it again. Well, that and some others that just used his tweet as troll material. So Cassper decided to go on a blocking spree... something he said has been long overdue.
