According to police spokesperson Lt Col Thulani Zwane, the vehicle  was hijacked between Dundee and Vryheid road near Tayside at about 10am. "It is alleged that two victims were driving a tobacco vehicle along Dundee and Vryheid road when they were allegedly stopped by three occupants of a VW Polo vehicle. They were threatened with firearms and the victims stopped and fled the scene on foot. "The suspects chased and caught them. They were forced into the suspects' vehicle and drove away with the victims' tobacco vehicle following each other.
