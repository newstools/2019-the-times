"I didn't think. I just jumped. I was very scared." That's what Karabo Thosago says about his life-saving jump to rescue Gareth Utton, 33, who almost drowned in the pool at Planet Fitness Craighall Park. After Thosago jumped into the pool, another staff member joined in the effort to save Utton. Thosago and his colleague Brandon Murigagumbo were honoured by Planet Fitness and Utton in a press conference on Thursday. "If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be here. I want to thank them for what they did," said Utton. Utton said his doctors have described it as an isolated incident and have given him a clean bill of health.
