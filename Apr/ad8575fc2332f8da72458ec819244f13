Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has until Friday, May 3, to furnish public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane with an affidavit to assist her in her investigation. Mkhwebane made this announcement on Tuesday as she acceded to Gordhan’s request on Monday for an extension of the deadline regarding the affidavit and supporting evidence he was due to submit on Tuesday. This is in connection with Mkhwebane’s investigation into allegations of improper conduct, a violation of the executive ethics code, and irregular and unlawful activities by Gordhan. Aspects of the investigation relate to his time as SA Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner. Mkhwebane said Gordhan requested the extension, citing a decision by Sars to procure a legal opinion from counsel on whether it would be lawful to share with implicated parties, including Gordhan, certain records that are in its possession. She said these were the records which she required for the purposes of her investigation. “In the spirit of fairness, I have decided to grant minister Gordhan the extension he has requested so that he may have a reasonable opportunity to gather the information I need as some of it goes a few years back,” Mkhwebane said. Mkhwebane said her office would subpoena the records in question directly from Sars. She said should her office not be favoured with the information held by Sars and, as a last resort, she would have to invoke the Public Protector Act, particularly contempt proceedings. Mkhwebane called on the public to grant her the space to do her work without any undue hindrance and treat this case as they would treat an investigation involving the alleged conduct of any other public office-bearer, in the spirit of equality before the law.
