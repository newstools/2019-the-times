ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule visited the community of Kliptown, Soweto, on Thursday.He went to Walter Sisulu Square in the heart of one of the oldest parts of the township to interact with potential voters.Â He said that giving money to the poor during election season does not mean that the party is buying votes. "We can't just go door to door when we find a young child with no shoes and leave them like that when we can buy shoes." He said that door-to-door visits should be done by politicians monthly. Here are five pictures from his visit.
