DA Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga has laid criminal charges against the ANC for allegedly inciting violence at Alexandra. Msimanga says the recent protest action, which resulted in Alexandra residents burning tyres and blocking several major roads into the area, were co-ordinated by the governing party "in order to influence the outcome of the general elections" next month. He claims to have evidence of the ANC's involvement. "I presented the [police] with evidence of how the ANC was conspiring to instigate violence by co-ordinating plans with local affiliates on the ground to embark on violent protest actions, and sow anarchy. The DA has seen WhatsApp messages from a SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) group, where activities aimed against Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba were co-ordinated," Msimanga said in a statement. "Furthermore, we have seen a WhatsApp exchange where one of the organisers infers that their actions are being supported by the ANC. Further digging on social media revealed that the organisers were wearing ANC regalia â€¦The protest is being led by ANC ward councillors, and not the legitimate community leadership who have raised issues with the City of Johannesburg. The councillors have resisted any attempt to hand over a memorandum to the City of Johannesburg and have blocked efforts by the City to hold meetings with community leadership." The protests were as result of a lack of service delivery, rampant crime and construction of illegal dwellings in the area. Msimanga issued this challenge to the ANC: "If they are serious about this issue, they will join us for a public meeting in Alex so they can answer for their time in office."
