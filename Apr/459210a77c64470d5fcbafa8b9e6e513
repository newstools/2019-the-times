A policeman and a reservist stationed at the Kensington police station are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday to face charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice. Police said the two, a constable aged 25 and the reservist aged 41, had executed a search warrant at the residence of a suspected drug merchant in Kensington on April 1 where a substantial amount of cash and mandrax tablets were seized and a suspect arrested. "However, after arriving at the police station only a portion of the tablets seized were booked in as being found abandoned and the suspect was released without being charged," Western Cape police said in a statement. Members of the police's anti-gang unit and their fellow police members arrested the two on Tuesday. Western Cape provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Khombinkosi Jula expressed concern about those entrusted with maintaining law and order finding themselves on the wrong side of the law. "There is no room for corrupt police members in this organisation, our mandate is to fight crime and bring perpetrators to book including our own, we trust that these arrests will send a warning to other would be criminal," Jula said.
