It's no secret that being a new mom isn't walk in the park. Even though mothers have mastered the art of multitasking and sometimes make things look so effortless, this couldn't be further from the truth. Lootlove and Reason welcomed their twin girls into the world a few months ago. And, while Lootlove loves every moment of motherhood, she's also honest about the chaos that comes with taking care of two newborns. She has been sharing snippets of what her life has been like since the arrival of their twins. And...it's hilarious! Don't for one second think maternity leave is a 'break' from work. This is what happens when your baby decides to boycott nap time. Me time. What's that? Lootlove announced the arrival of their twins by sharing the sweetest post about how blessed she feels to be their mom. ""I can’t believe my God loves me this much. I can’t believe these perfect, beautiful baby girls chose me to be their Mom. I’ve finally transformed into: Mommy Love."
