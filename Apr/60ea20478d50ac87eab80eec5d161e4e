Date My Family fans were felt like they had been sold a dream but ended up with a nightmare when Mpumi's uncle told bachelor Mandla that his niece was the Mzansi equivalent of Kim Kardashian. Malume could sell ice to eskimos and had everyone on the edge of their seats in anticipation. Even Mandla fell for it, choosing her for his date at the end of the episode. But sis wasn't here for happily ever afters and soon made it clear that there would be no second date. Her criteria was strict: no DJs, no fake guys and no hustlers. But the streets thought she was as fake as her twang and speculated that sis was only here to alert potential blessers. Fans were gatvol of her tricks and made it clear through memes and messages that she must take her "Kim K" status elsewhere.
