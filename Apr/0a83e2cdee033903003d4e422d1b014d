Contrary to stereotypes being a stay at home mom and wife doesn't mean long coffee dates with friends or spending hours at the nail salon, instead its days filled with chores and errands to make sure everyone in the family is taken care of. Zoleka Mandela who is a housewife and has a successful career as a motivational speaker, and is battling depression penned a heartfelt letter to other housewives.

Some housewives are truly thankful for moments like these, even when the babies in these pictures poop, pee and throw up on them on the daily!"

Some housewives have to post pictures just like these ones to remind other housewives that even at their worst, they’ll always be the most incredible." Here's her full post:
