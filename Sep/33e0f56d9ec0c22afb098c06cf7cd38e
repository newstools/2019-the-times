Bafana Bafana’s hastily organised international friendly against Madagascar has been called off. The South African Football Association (Safa) did not immediately give the reasons for the Indian Ocean islanders' decision to withdraw from the match on Thursday afternoon. Original opponents Zambia pulled out earlier in the week citing safety concerns following the xenophobic attacks that broke out in Gauteng. This means new Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will have to wait a little longer for his first match in charge of the senior national team. “SAFA regrets to inform the public that the match between Bafana Bafana and Madagascar scheduled for this coming Saturday (7 September) has been called off after the visitors (Madagascar) decided to withdraw from the encounter‚” said Safa.
