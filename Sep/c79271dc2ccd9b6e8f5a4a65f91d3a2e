Instead of welcoming a gleeful group of bright-eyed children into her classroom, a preschool teacher – the alleged mastermind behind the kidnap and ransom plot of Amy’Leigh de Jager – will stand in the dock of the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court. The woman and two alleged cohorts, who cannot be named until they have appeared before a magistrate, were arrested last week after their brazen plot unravelled. Their alleged scheme was set in motion when four men grabbed the grade R pupil from her mother, Angeline, outside the gates of Laerskool Kollegepark on Monday morning. They bundled her into a white Toyota Fortuner before speeding off.
