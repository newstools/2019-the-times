"When he took that gun, he ran inside Slovo and he was shooting," Slovo Park resident Henny Mathe said, recounting the death of Karabo Ditire, who was washing his two-year-old daughter's clothes when he was killed. Ditire's killing, allegedly by a Somali shop owner, led to Slovo Park residents looting nearby stores in retaliation. Mathe claims another Slovo Park resident, Isaac Sebako, was shot while carrying two crates of looted goods. Sebako and Mathe are among 11 people who died during a week of xenophobic violence in Gauteng. Slovo Park, a squatter camp in Coronationville, is one of many areas in Johannesburg that experienced violence. Community leader Doctor Selotlego described the situation as war. Selotlego attributed the incidents to extreme poverty experienced by a large percentage of South Africans. Foreigners not hiring South Africans was another factor, he said. The recent outbreaks of xenophobia have resulted in South Africa facing backlash from other African countries, including Zambia and Nigeria.
