Despite the EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu denying claims that he purchased his luxury Range Rover Sport with funds from the looted VBS bank, social media has called on the politician to share paperwork from the transaction to prove his innocence. Mail & Guardian reported that Shivambu was under scrutiny following a report that the Hawks were investigating the luxury car he allegedly bought with cash in January 2018. According to the publication, the vehicle was registered in Shivambu's name before it was changed to his cousin's name, Musa Shivambu, around December 2018. The luxury vehicle retails for at least R1.1 million. Shivambu took to Twitter to dismiss the claims, saying the car he owned was bought through a trade-in and was financed “long before any VBS”. “The difference paid is nowhere close to the R1 million,” he added. Shivambu has repeatedly denied he ever benefited from the looted bank, despite growing allegations. TimesLIVE previously reported  he denied links to VBS, calling the allegations against him and his brother, Brian Shivambu, a “wild goose chase”. On social media, many felt the matter could be resolved if he produces receipts. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions:
