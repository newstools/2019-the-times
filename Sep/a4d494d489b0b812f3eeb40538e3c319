We eat with our eyes, we all know that, but add branding and packaging and one's opinion of a product is often swayed before they've even tasted it. So to ensure our tastings are free and fair, all packaging is removed before products are presented to our panel of judges. The products are also numbered and, if required, prepared exactly to package instructions. Food expert Jenny Kay is on hand in the kitchen to ensure fairness while this all happens. Our judges are then asked to rate each product on a score-sheet according to appearance, aroma, taste — and whether they would buy it or not. Auditor Jade Craig oversees the whole process, collates all the scores and draws up a report.
