The Constitutional Court ruled on Wednesday that spanking children was illegal. The ConCourt said the ruling had its roots in a 2017 case, in which a father was convicted of assaulting his 13-year-old son. It further stated that the ruling was meant to advance SA towards non-violence. South African Twitter users had some funny reactions to the ruling.
