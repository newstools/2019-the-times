Gauteng MEC for education and youth development Panyaza Lesufi on Friday morning visited a Midrand school where two pupils allegedly committed suicide this week. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said it happened at Noordwyk High Secondary. Following the visit,Â Lesufi confirmed that 17-year-old Dimakatso Shai committed suicide on Monday, and fellow pupil, 18-year-old Seandaryl Masuku, took his life on Thursday. "Unfortunately, it is unknown what prompted the two deceased learners to commit suicide. Police are investigating circumstances surrounding both deaths," said Mabona. However, it was earlier reported that the two were dating. Lesufi said: "It is unfortunate and regrettable that learners took their own lives in this manner. We take this time to send our heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and the school community, during this time of grief. No words are enough to express our sorrow at a loss of a child. We hope that the families will find comfort in the knowledge that we too share their loss." He encouraged pupils to "focus on their education and refrain from other things that may have a negative impact on their studies". "Learners are also urged to utilise support programmes availed to them if they experience any challenges," Lesufi said. The Psycho-Social Unit was dispatched to the school, and plans are being put in place with LifeLine to offer a suicide prevention programme to the school and neighbouring schools.
