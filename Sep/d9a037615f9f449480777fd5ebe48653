“If they want to charge [me], they must charge [me].” These were the words of EFF leader Julius Malema outside the Hawks headquarters in Pretoria on Tuesday. Malema arrived at the office of the crime-fighting unit over claims that he fired a rifle at the party's birthday celebrations in East London last year. “I don't know why they are being dramatic. In the past ... the Hawks have never had a problem meeting with us,” said Malema. Supporters came out in full support of the EFF leader. Malema told them that the cases opened against him and his party were merely a distraction from the serious issues faced by SA. “They just want to smear the EFF,” he claimed.
