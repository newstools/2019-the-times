Can someone please organise Cardi B a SA ID and a trip to ekasi, sis is a HUGE fan of chicken feet, just like us. Cardi B had the internet feeling all kinds of ways on Wednesday when she rolled up on the socials to record herself eating some chicken. It may have been nothing out of the ordinary for the US star but it got hella serious when sis put chicken feet in her mouth and did the most. Sis was going in hard on them feet and you could hear the munch as she chewed. Even the way she licked up the spillage and spat out the bones reminded us of weekend on the dusty streets of ekasi. And we weren't the only ones who were getting those vibes. Soon the comments section and Twitter TLs were filled with reaction to Cardi's dinner, with one user even joking how unemployed slay queens were demanding meals from high-end restaurants while a whole superstar and millionaire was chowing feet. Here were some of our favourite reactions. Others were not convinced by the whole chicken feet thing and not even Cardi was going to convince them to try it.
