“Hey, hey, come here, where's Archie?” These were the words of an 81-year old Cape Town woman who was delighted to meet the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Cape Town on Monday. In a video shared by journalist and Royal editor, Emily Nash, the woman excitedly extends a hug to Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle before the couple proceeds to greet a young man in a wheelchair. According to Nash, the woman is a staunch follower of the Royals and was one of many who met the Queen during her visit in the city in 1947. She is one of the people who were forcibly removed from Cape Town's District Six. The arrival of the duo continues to be met with much excitement by South Africans. During their visit to the District Six Museum, they learnt about the forced removals of coloured people from  multiracial suburbs in the 1960s by the apartheid government. They were moved to the Cape Flats.
