GladAfrica Championship team Pretoria University have signed skilful South Africa Under-23 forward Kamohelo Mahlatsi from SuperSport United on loan on the last night of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) transfer window. The 2019-20 preseason transfer window closes at midnight on Monday. Mahlatsi (21) is currently on national U-23 duty with coach David Notoane’s team who meet Zimbabwe on Friday at Orlando Stadium in a third-round (final stage before the tournament) 2019 U-23 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Mahlatsi starred for Notoane’s shadow U-23 team who represented South Africa at the 2019 Cosafa Cup in Durban, beating Malawi on penalties in the final in June. He is the second SA U-23 international signed on loan by AmaTuks from SuperSport for the 2019-20 season, following midfielder Athenkosi Dladla. Tuks narrowly avoided relegation from the First Division last season, finishing fourth.
