Three men and a child were rescued by a local fishing vessel after their boat capsized near Bluff in Durban on Tuesday. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Durban station commander, Jonathan Kellerman, said a team was deployed just before 10am after receiving a report of a capsized boat. "On arrival on the scene we found the local fishing boat Mad Max had rescued three adults and a child from the water..." Kellerman said the four were taken to the NSRI  station for a medical assessment by paramedics. "One man, who suffered minor injuries, was transported to hospital in a stable condition by ambulance for further care." Kellerman said the boat was towed to the Vetch's Pier vicinity, where it was recovered.
