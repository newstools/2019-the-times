The escalation in gender-based violence has sparked a mass mobilisation of South Africans in recent weeks. With many accusing the government of turning a blind eye, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on September 5 was met with hostility. Many have called for a return to the death penalty as a solution, as well as making the National Register for Sex Offenders (NRSO) public. Advocacy group Women & Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA) has expressed its concerns regarding the functionality and mechanisms of the register, however. Ramaphosa has since outlined the government's action plan to fight gender-based violence, including launching a special fund.
