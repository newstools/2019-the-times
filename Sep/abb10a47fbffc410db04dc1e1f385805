That Nandi Madida and K.O combo stays communicating and after dominating charts, the pair have released a music video for their latest single Say U Will. The pair, who first gave us serious #CoupleGoals with their love song Skhanda Love, have been doing the most with their latest single. And now that everyone and their gogo knows the tune, the pair dropped a video for the track. The video, released earlier this week, is partly based in an old school barber shop where all the community tea is usually spilled. It's got a real 90s RnB feel and we can't stop stannin.
