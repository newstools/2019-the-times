Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng continues testifying at the state capture inquiry on Wednesday. Motsoeneng began his testimony on Tuesday, and admitted to taking his group chief executive Lulama Mokhobo to see the Guptas, at their request, when she was appointed in 2012. Mokhobo previously told the commission that Motsoeneng hurried her away from her desk about a week into her tenure and took her to the Gupta family's Saxonwold residence. At the house, she said Gupta brothers Ajay and Atul, along with Duduzane Zuma, lobbied her to allow them access to the SABC's digital channels. "I went in together with Hlaudi. I do recall my phone and everyone else's phone was taken and the batteries removed. We then went into a dining room where the people present proceeded to congratulate me. I think it was Ajay, Atul, Duduzane Zuma and Ace Magashuleâ€™s son [Tshepo Magashule]," she told the commission at the time. "We enjoy curry there big time, chairperson, together. I was acting as the GCEO [group chief operations officer]. It was part of the handover. I said to her, 'look, compliance informed me there is this relationship between The New Age and SABC, but we as SABC are not complying because there is no memorandum of understanding on this matter," said Motsoeneng. "These people (Guptas), they talked to me to say they would be happy if we can meet your new GCEO'," he told the commission. The hearing continues.
