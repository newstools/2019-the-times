The JSE closed firmer on Thursday, in line with most global markets, as progress in the US-China trade war lifted sentiment. China's commerce ministry confirmed on Thursday that the US and China would meet in Washington DC in October to resume trade negotiations. Trade teams from both economic superpowers will hold ministerial-level talks in mid-September. “The lift in risk sentiment appears mitigated by the concern that the latest positive developments surrounding the US-China trade impasse may prove fleeting, and does not yet fully nullify the downside risks to the global economy,” FXTM  market analyst Han Tan said, however. “In order for risk sentiment to push significantly higher, markets will need to be shown material signs that US and China are indeed drawing closer to a meaningful and lasting trade deal,” Tan said .
