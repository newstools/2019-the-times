Getting parents to learn the term selfie is almost as difficult as getting them to stand still for a picture. So when Atandwa Kani played a joke on his dad, telling him to smile for a picture when it was actually a video, he represented all of us. Shem. And then John Kani even tells his son to move the camera around so that there's a different background for the "picture". Funny and heartwarming, Atandwa paid tribute to his dad in the caption. "I strive daily to be a tenth of this man's greatness." All the feels. Watch the video below.
