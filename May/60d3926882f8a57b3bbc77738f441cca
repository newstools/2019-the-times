President Cyril Ramaphosa is  the man in charge at the Union Buildings in Tshwane, but speculation abounds regarding who will be his deputy. As South Africa waits for Ramaphosa to announce his deputy president and  cabinet later this week, here are five must-read articles relating to the  deputy president. Speculation ANC deputy president David Mabuza dismissed speculation that he might not return as the country's second-in-command  when President Cyril Ramaphosa announces his new executive in the coming days. "Hayi, well, no, all the speculations are wrong," said Mabuza. These comments were made prior to Mabuza not being sworn in as a member of the National Assembly. Postponement Mabuza asked not to be sworn in as a member of parliament on May 22. The ANC released a statement claiming that Mabuza asked for a postponement until he had addressed the ANC's integrity commission, which red-flagged him and other party figures as not suitable to represent the governing ANC in parliament. Cabinet On Sunday, Ramaphosa delayed announcing his cabinet after reportedly consulting with Mabuza and other senior ANC leaders. Madonsela for deputy president? Naah! Social media users were excited about the prospect of former public protector Thuli Madonsela being named Ramaposa's right-hand woman, but that was quickly shut down with two reasons: she's not a member of the National Assembly and she's not on the ANC's 2019 electoral list. Extra time Some people's patience is wearing thin. However, many have expressed confidence in whatever decision Ramaphosa  makes and encouraged other South Africans to give him time and support. The Mail & Guardian  reports that Mabuza will be sworn in on Tuesday.
