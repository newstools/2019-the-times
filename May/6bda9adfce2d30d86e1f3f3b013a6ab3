It took a softer approach, however, than its counterpart Moody’s, which recently issued stark warnings to the government to address the country’s mounting debt burden. Moody’s is the only major ratings agency with an investment-grade rating on the country’s debt. “With S&P already rating SA’s long-term sovereign debt sub-investment grade, its slightly poorer assessment on some of the government finance metrics has not led it to change its rating or even outlook, although it does warn that further marked fiscal deterioration could cause it to lower its ratings of SA’s long-term sovereign debt,” said Investec economist Annabel Bishop.
