Despite a record of 48 parties contesting the national elections, only 14 of them will serve in the National Assembly. This is according to Electoral Commission chairperson Glen Mashinini, who announced the election results on Saturday. “For the sixth time and the 26th year in a row, the majority party in the National Assembly of South Africa will be the ANC with 230 seats,” he said. The party is down by 19 seats in the National Assembly as it secured 57.7% of the vote nationally. Mashinini announced that the official opposition in the sixth parliament will be the DA with 84 seats. The EFF showed the most increase in seats with 44 seats in the National Assembly. They are followed by the IFP with 14 seats, Freedom Front Plus with 10 and the ACDP with four seats. The NFP, UDM, Good, Cope, ATM and AIC all received two seats each. Al Jama’ah and the PAC will be in the Nation Assembly with one seat each. “We had our share of multi parties contesting this round,” Mashinini said. He said that the country remains a shining beacon of democracy and human rights.
