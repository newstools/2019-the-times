A talented Uber driver has been making headlines after he serenaded a passenger with his opera-singing talent. Gauteng resident Kim Davey shared a video of Menzi Mngoma singing for her in an Uber cab in Durban. Davey posted the video on her Facebook page, calling for agents to help the talented singer make his dreams come true - and it has already had more than a half million views. Radio host Martin Bester saw the story and got hold of Mngona. In an interview on Jacaranda FM, Mngona told Bester he started singing when he was in high school. "My gift is from God," Mngona said. He told Bester that his parents were not working and he was not able to provide for them. His big dream is to start a business. Jacaranda gave Mngona R5,000 to kickstart his dream.
