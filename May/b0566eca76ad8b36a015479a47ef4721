Days after the general elections, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule continues to make headlines. From dismissing comments that the party was rescued by President Cyril Ramaphosa and butting heads with the ANC's head of elections Fikile Mbalula, here are four must-read stories on Magashule. Ramaphosa didn't save ANC Magashule dismissed comments that the party was rescued by Ramaphosa in the 2019 national and provincial elections. Speaking during a news conference at the IEC national results operations centre in Pretoria, he said supporters voted for the party, not an individual. Party politics On Friday Magashule hit back at Mbalula for saying the ANC would have scored less than 40% of the votes if Ramaphosa was not elected party leader in 2017. "That's nonsense, people are electing the ANC. It's not about any individual. How do you predict that? Is Comrade Mbalula saying I was not going to be part of the campaign if the leader was somebody else?" Magashule asked. Election results Magashule said the party would not discuss the outcome of the general elections at its national executive committee meeting in Irene, near Pretoria, on Monday. However, it would discuss candidates for the position of premier in the eight provinces the ANC will govern, as well as who would be the leader of its official opposition in Western Cape. Female provincial legislatures Upon announcing the five of the seven premier candidates on Monday in Irene, Magashule said speakers in all provincial legislature would be women, irrespective of whether the premier was male or female. "There was a consensus that in instances where the premier is a female there shall be at least 50:50 representation in the provincial executive," Magashule said.
