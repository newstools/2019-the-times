Take notes from the whimsical shows of Simone Rocha and layer hair barrettes in pearl finishes for a modern twist on vintage. Calling all maximalists - dive head first into this trend. Mix and match posh clips with schoolgirl accessories or silvers with golds. Toughen up the girly alice band Ã  la Gossip Girl's Blair Waldorf and sport metallic chain headbands to complete boho-style hair. For those not keen to sport childhood clips but want in on the trend action, a simple embellishment of the central parting of the hair will make any sleek, flyaway-free style look playful.
