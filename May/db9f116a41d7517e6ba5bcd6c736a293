Limpopo police arrested 11 people on Tuesday for allegedly killing three suspected criminals in a mob justice attack on Sunday. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said on Tuesday that Lismond Walter Morasehla, 35, Tshepiso Maukwe, 27, and Kamogelo Sekgobela, 17, were killed on Sunday morning in Mokwakwaila, near Tzaneen. “The three were brutally killed after they were accused of being responsible for crime in the area,” said Mojapelo. The suspects - aged between 15 and 42 - were arrested in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Mawa, also near Tzaneen. “The arrested suspects include seven men and four women. One of the suspects is the owner of the local tavern,” said Mojapelo. The police confiscated a bakkie that was allegedly used to transport some community members to where the attack took place. The suspects are expected to appear in the Kgapane Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. “More arrests are possible,” added Mojapelo.
