South Africa will be without experienced pace bowler Dale Steyn for Thursday’s Cricket World Cup opener against England at The Oval after failing to shake off a recurring shoulder problem. Steyn, who was injured during the Indian Premier League and has not played since April 21, is considered South Africa’s greatest fast bowler and returned to the one-day international team last November after two years on the sidelines with shoulder and foot injuries. South Africa coach Ottis Gibson had previously suggested that Steyn, who will turn 36 during the World Cup, would not be ready for the start of the tournament and his absence was confirmed on Tuesday. The Proteas have also had injury concerns over their two other main strike bowlers, Lungi Ngidi (side) and Kagiso Rabada (back), though both played in the warm-up win over Sri Lanka last week. All-rounders Chris Morris and Dwaine Pretorius are in the frame to replace Steyn. Fast bowler Anrich Nortje was ruled out before the tournament because of a thumb fracture sustained in training. - Reuters
