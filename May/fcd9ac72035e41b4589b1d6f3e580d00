"This series deserves a final season that makes sense," reads a online petition started by a disgruntled Game of Thrones fan who is calling for HBO to remake season 8. More than 430,000 people have signed the petition so far, which reflects how many fans are disappointed with the way their favourite show seems to be rushing towards its conclusion. Social media has been awash with negative comments about the new series, particularly after last week's penultimate episode, The Bells. To squeeze everything into just six — albeit longer than normal — episodes, some fans have accused the writers of taking shortcuts with characters' story arcs and killing off key characters without much fanfare. "David Benioff and DB Weiss have proven themselves to be woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material (ie the books) to fall back on," reads the petition. Will Benioff and Weiss redeem themselves by treating viewers to a spectacular finale? We'll find out when the final episode airs on Monday.
