At the start of this season, the Vodacom Bulls teamed up with Vodacom, SuperSport and every other South African team to support the #TacklingCancer campaign in aid of the Childhood Cancer Foundation (Choc). For every tackle made by a South African player in this yearâ€™s Vodacom Super Rugby competition, Vodacom and SuperSport will jointly donate R100 to Choc in support of the many children who have to face the hardest hits that life can dish out. The Vodacom Bulls have already raised R127,500 this season. On June 15, Sunday Times sports editor BBK will be joined by former Vodacom Bulls legends and local celebrities in the Vodacom Bulls #TacklingCancer Cycle-a-Thon to raise funds for children living with cancer. The cycle-a-thon will take place during the Vodacom Bulls vs Emirate Lions match at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on June 15 2019. During the match, BBK will cycle as far as he can on a stationary bike located on the side of the field as the public donate to Choc.  About the #TacklingCancer campaign Rugby fans can also contribute by adding R5 for Choc to every Vodacom Super Rugby match ticket they purchase, by buying Choc merchandise at the Choc shops that will be at every stadium for the South African derbies, or by making a donation at www.choc.org.
