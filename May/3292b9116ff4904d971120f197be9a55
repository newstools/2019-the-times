Belgian defender Vincent Kompany said on Sunday he would be leaving Manchester City after helping the Premier League club to a become the first team to win the English treble of league championship and both domestic cups. "We’ve just seen the close of an incredible season. My 11th as a Blue. And I cannot believe I’m writing this but ... also my last as a Blue," the City captain wrote in an open letter to fans on his Facebook page. "Man City has given me everything. I’ve tried to give back as much as I possibly could. How often does someone get the chance to end such an important chapter, representing a club with such great history and tradition, in such a great fashion?" "The time has come for me to go now." The 33-year-old central defender said he would be posting a second part of the letter "shortly" with details of his future plans. City crushed Watford 6-0 in the FA Cup final on Saturday to complete the unprecedented treble, after which Kompany said they were the best team in the world. Kompany scored with a thunderous long-range strike to decide their penultimate league match of the season against Leicester City, a key moment in their retaining the Premier League title. "It’s cliché to say it but it’s also so true: without my teammates I would have never been here today," he added. "We fought many battles together. Side by side. In good times and in bad. So to all of you, from the 2008-2009 squad to today’s domestic Treble winners: I owe you guys! "A special word also to (manager) Pep (Guardiola) and the backroom staff: you’ve been superb. You’ve followed me through so much hardship. You made me come back stronger every time. Thank you so much."
