Tbo Touch impersonating a taxi driver who's in a bad mood is the most hilarious thing you'll see today, unless it happened to you this morning, then askies mntase! Touch took to social media this week to share how he decided to bless his kids with some valuable public transportation lessons and provided amazing comedy simultaneously! "I realise my boys have never in a taxi, so I decided to call Bra Ace to give them a lesson. Look close, both seat belts on waist lock and these ninjas locked me out," he said with laughing emojis. Calling himself "Bra Ace" (which is a surprisingly common taxi driver name, come to think of it), Touch decided to help his kids experience what people go through on the daily. Meanwhile, all we could think about is how lucky are Tbo Touch's kids? They will have the experience without the trauma. Fam, because they are in a luxury car and their father is just playing a role, they can laugh about it. You try finding humour when you are running late and the driver pulls this stunt. Or when the culprit with the missing cash ain't feeling like coughing up! Yeah, not so funny now, neh?
