A 50-year-old woman who was allegedly abducted on Friday morning near Port Shepstone, on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast, has been found “safe and sound”, police confirmed on Saturday. A police spokesperson confirmed that Greying had been found on Friday evening, but no further details were immediately available. A friend confirmed that she was “safe and sound”.
