In an interview with SABC, Ngcobo said he has been passionate about politics since he was in primary school. "Martin Luther King inspired me when he said our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter. I then said to myself, I have to be in politics and help people."

Chirwa is an actor, feminist and EFF student activist.

She is currently the party's media and communications officer for the student command. Nompendulo Mkhatshwa - ANC Nompendulo Mkhatshwa, 25, like Chirwa rose to prominence through the #FeesMustFall protests in 2015.Â  Even then she was open about her love for the ANC and wore the party's doek during protests, on magazine covers and in magazine interviews. Mkhatshwa studied towards a bachelor of science at Wits University, where she was the leader of the SRC. She was number 101 on the ANC national list of party members heading to parliament.
