We know that taste is a subjective thing and what’s good for one may not be for someone else. But it is interesting that, when a group of tasters come together, the results are usually consistent — there’s always a favourite and least-favoured item. For this taste test, we invited a group of mothers to attend a blind-tasting in Johannesburg. On the menu? Fruit salad and double cream plain yogurt from a selection of top supermarkets. To ensure the taste test was free and fair, food expert Jenny Kaye was in the kitchen to supervise as products were removed from their packaging, numbered and, where necessary, cooked or reheated according to package instructions. Auditor Jade Craig oversaw the entire process: she checked the products in the kitchen, sat in on the tasting, and collated the scores.
