South Africa's general elections have come and gone, but they  remain dominant on social media, as South Africans continue to weigh in on their experiences at  voting stations, as well as their expectations of  the party which will emerge victorious. #SAelections2019 was the key hashtag used  by politicians and the public. While the final results will be released on Saturday, Twitter theorists and hopefuls are  expressing their opinions  on which party they think will win. Politicians also engaged,  urging voters to give their parties a chance. Most tweeps' votes were no secret.  Some made it clear  before the elections who they would vote for, while others disclosed their choices  after putting pen to  paper at the polls. Others  went as far as posting pictures of themselves in  party regalia.
