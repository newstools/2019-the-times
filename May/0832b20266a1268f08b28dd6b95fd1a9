I do think that schoolchildren should learn about life and that includes sex, but to introduce the subject of “touching oneself for pleasure” to children coming out of the foundation phase is pure dumb. But the new policy has nothing to do with changing schools or improving lives; it is all about appearing modern, or woke, even if you’re not.
