Final results wonâ€™t be official for a few days yet, but the first batch of results from the 2019 election is expected before midnight. So says the Electoral Commission (IEC), which was commenting after voting came to an end on Wednesday. Voting stations had closed at 9pm, except for those people who were in the queue. Some results, however, will be out in just a few hours. "The first results from voting districts with the smallest number of voters are expected to reflect on the results system before midnight tonight," the IEC said. According to the elections body, this is how the counting process will work: By law, all ballots must be securely retained for six months in case of objections.
