The Blue Bulls Company have confirmed that Springboks flyhalf Handré Pollard will join French club Montpellier and he is set to be replaced by the returning Morne Steyn who is due to arrive at Loftus next season. Pollard‚ who is currently with the Bulls in Melbourne where they are preparing to take on the Rebels on Friday morning‚ indicated his intention to leave for France during discussions about the renewal of his contract. The flyhalf‚ who has scored 581 points for the Bulls in 56 matches so far‚ joined the Pretoria side in 2013 fresh from school and became a Springbok in 2014 where he has featured in 39 tests and 339 points. Blue Bulls Company chief executive‚ Alfons Meyer said:“Handre has been a true servant for us for six years. "He has been an outstanding asset‚ not only to the teams he played for‚ but also our supporters‚ to whom he endeared himself from early on with his attitude towards the Bulls. "He will be missed for sure‚ but we cannot fault his decision to continue his career in France. We wish him well.” Steyn‚ who is still the all-time points-scorer for the Bulls with 1449 amassed from 124 matches‚ returns home for his swansong from a successful stint overseas Meyer continued: “It is great for us‚ he is a very experienced player who can still play at the highest levels. "He knows the culture and passion of the Bulls as well as any one and will no doubt contribute massively‚ not only on the field‚ but also off it. "We are very pleased to have him back in the Bull kraal.”
