The CW has unleashed the first trailer for its Batwoman series, starring Australian actress Ruby Rose as the caped crusader in female form. The show follows the common theme of a central hero fighting crime, but will make history with the debut of Rose as the first openly gay lead character - male or female - of a live-action superhero series (via Deadline). Also starring Meagan Tandy, Camrus Johnson, Nicole Kang, Rachel Skarsten and Dougray Scott, Batwoman follows Kate Kane - an out lesbian and highly-trained street fighter with a passion for social justice and a whole lot of attitude - as she transforms from angsty rebel into the city's saving grace. The robust trailer, which runs at just over three-minutes, introduces Jacob Kane - head of private security firm Crows Private Security - and his feisty daughter, a cousin to Bruce Wayne, who has gone in the midst of a crime wave when the adventure begins.
