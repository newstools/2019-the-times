Three men accused of being house robbers were beaten to death in a mob justice attack in Ga-Wally village in Mokwakwaila, outside Tzaneen, on Sunday. The trio were hunted down by community members after an unknown man entered an elderly woman's home. She was attacked and screamed for help, after which the community reacted. "Preliminary police investigations revealed that this brutal attack follows a chain of events that commenced at around midnight when an intruder allegedly got into a house of an elderly woman. The woman reportedly screamed for help and community members of the said village consequently mobilised and hunted down the intruder until they caught three unknown middle-aged men.
