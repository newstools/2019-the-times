The Zondo commission into state capture will hear aviation-related testimony from Industrial Development  Corporation (IDC) chief risk officer Mark Phakamile Mainganya. His testimony will centre on how an IDC official, who brought in a project that received millions of rand from the corporation, ended up being the beneficiary. Director of Neo Solutions Vivien Natasen  shared his aviation-related testimony with the commission on Thursday. In scathing testimony before the inquiry on Wednesday, former Free State economic development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana detailed Ace Magashule's alleged involvement as premier in what is known as the "asbestos heist" in the province. Current ANC secretary general, and former Free State premier, Magashule was described as a "blesser of many" who blatantly abused his power and laundered money from the public purse.
