Businessman Adam Catzavelos must pay R150,000 in damages for using a racial slur directed at black South Africans, according to a deal he has struck with the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). The money, to be paid monthly, will be given to a charitable organisation focusing on social cohesion. Catzavelos' lawyers signalled previously that they were negotiating an out-of-court settlement with the SAHRC, which had brought a complaint of hate speech against him in the Equality Court. Earlier on Thursday, the SAHRC shared a written apology from Catzavelos. The court is expected to be asked to ratify the settlement later on Thursday.
