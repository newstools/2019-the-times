A German tourist slipped and fell about 70m at Lisbon Falls in Mpumalanga on Wednesday afternoon. She was later brought successfully to the surface. She suffered rib fractures and was in a stable condition. She was being transported to hospital on Wednesday night. Emer-G-Med spokesperson Martin Jeffrey said the female tourist fell about 70m into a ravine. He said paramedics were not able to get to her by foot and were waiting for rope technicians to get to the scene. “Currently the tourist is safe and stable. She is able to communicate with us but we are still unsure on the extent of her injuries,” Jeffrey said. Before her rescue, a doctor was lowered to the tourist but Jeffrey said the woman was further down than expected. Initially it was thought she fell about 40m.
