Just hours before millionaire tobacco boss Simon Rudland was critically wounded in an attempted assassination in Norwood, Johannesburg on Wednesday, another cigarette-manufacturing tycoon, Yusuf Kajee, sounded an ominous warning. Included in Kajee’s warning was a spoiled assassination attempt on another player in the cigarette industry. On the morning of the shooting Rudland had just pulled into the driveway of Fita’s (Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association) offices when a white VW Golf stopped behind him. One of the occupants opened fire, spraying his black Porsche with bullets. Rudland, who was shot in the neck, was rushed to a Johannesburg hospital by his lawyer, who was driving the car, where he is understood to be in a critical condition.
