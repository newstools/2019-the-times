Footage of a rescued kingsnake self-cannibalising has been captured in Pennsylvania, US. The rare footage was captured on August 9 2019. The serpent eats half of its body before a rescuer stops it from doing so. Kingsnakes are known to eat other snakes, and sometimes mistake their own tails for food, but reptile handler Jesse Rothacker says heâ€™s never seen anything like this. Rothacker runs the Forgotten Friend Reptile Sanctuary in Pennsylvania, and said snakes trying to eat themselves is unusual but not unheard of.
