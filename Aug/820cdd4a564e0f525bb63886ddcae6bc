Tell us about your collaboration with H&M. The range is a compilation of Mantsho's bestsellers from our last three collections. It consists of a few dresses, a skirt, pants, kimonos and tops as well as a range of accessories including shoes, clutches and earings. Expect to see what we at Mantsho call the Mmabatho dress and the Shekisha skirt in new prints, amongst others. Tell us about the prints and colours you chose. We created three new prints for it using the signature Mantsho face/flower. How did you work with them to create this collection? What was it like? H&M specifically did not want to dilute the African influence. Neither did I. So together we created an affordable Mantsho Collection. H&M's biggest role was to support and advise on the best possible and affordable ways to do so. How did you translate the signature Mantsho aesthetic into a collection that will stand out in the global market? Because I have a store and have been in the industry for a long time making unique ready- to-wear garments for boutiques and chain stores, I understand the mind of the consumer and their spending habits so I decided to tweak the fabrics a little to suit chain store price points but still went all out creating my own prints because that's what Mantsho is about and for the first time I had an opportunity to create an accessories line - there are shoes, bags and earrings. Why a is collaboration like this important? I feel like it's time for them to show diversity and "togetherness" as a demonstration that they are learning from their mistakes. â€¢ The Mantsho x H&M collection is available at H&M stores from August 15.
