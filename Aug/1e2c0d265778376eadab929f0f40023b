The Durban High Court is hearing an application for an interdict and a defamation lawsuit brought by former cabinet minister Derek Hanekom against former president Jacob Zuma. This is after Zuma called Hanekom a spy in a recent tweet. Hanekom is suing Zuma for R500,000 in damages after Zuma tweeted in July that Hanekom was a "known enemy agent".
