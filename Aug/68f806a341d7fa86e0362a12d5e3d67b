A cash-in-transit heist in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, ended tragically when civilians were shot and wounded and a petrol attendant succumbed to his injuries. The incident took place on Friday at an Engen filling station near Midwater Centre when four men attacked a guard carrying a bag of cash. The suspects jumped into a waiting car and tried to make their getaway, but were stopped when the cash van smashed into their vehicle. A shoot-out ensued across the forecourt. A petrol attendant was shot and later died from his injuries in hospital. Two customers were hit in the legs by bullets when the suspects allegedly began shooting "at random". Video footage showed terrified people hiding under vehicles and running for cover.
