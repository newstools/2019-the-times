Singer Troye Sivan has lashed out after being asked in an interview if he was a “top or bottom”, telling fans on Twitter that it was a wildly invasive question. A New Zealand reporter posed the question to the SA-Australian musician for Express, a proudly LGBTQ New Zealand publication. Posting a copy of the article on his Twitter page, Troye said he considered asking the reporter about his sexual preferences, but declined because it was “inappropriate”. His post had received more than 72,000 likes at the time of publishing this article, with many expressing shock at the incident. Troye said “next time I'll do a q&a”.
