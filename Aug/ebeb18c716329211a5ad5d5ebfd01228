A R2.5m vegetable packhouse, completed five years ago for a women’s co-operative run by Jacob Zuma’s wife Sizakele MaKhumalo Zuma, is an empty shell after political squabbling and two burglaries that caused R1.9m in damage. The row between the ANC-run department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs and the IFP-controlled municipality has reduced the warehouse – a stone’s throw from Zuma’s Nkandla homestead – to a white elephant.
