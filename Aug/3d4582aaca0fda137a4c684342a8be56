The Gautrain Management Agency is partnering the Sunday Times to present yet another Leaders on the Move tour, where a limited number of delegates have the opportunity to spend an hour with three prominent business leaders. Leaders on the Move is a novel concept that takes a group of “tomorrow’s business leaders” to meet SA’s top business executives face-to-face, in a unique mentorship programme facilitated by a leading media commentator. This is not the first time that the Gautrain Management Agency has partnered the Leaders on the Move series. “It provides an opportunity to promote and profile the Gautrain Management Agency as a thought leader in the public transport industry while educating current and potential users of the benefits of using the Gautrain service,” says Dr Barbara Jensen Vorster, Gautrain Management Agency's senior executive manager for  communication and marketing. The hour-long sessions with each executive are designed to encourage upward mobility among the country’s future leaders, and impart knowledge that can’t be taught at business school. Leaders on the Move provides unique networking opportunities for delegates, who also enjoy lunch together. Date: September 6 2019Time: 7am to 3.30pmStarting point: Johannesburg Want to board the bus?
