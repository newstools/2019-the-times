A quick-thinking firefighter, who noticed flames on the way to an accident scene, helped save the occupants of a double-storey home in Cape Town early on Friday. The officer in charge of firefighters from Gugulethu, who had been dispatched to treat a pedestrian who had been knocked down in Duinefontein Road, saw flames in the vicinity of Samora Machel at 6.37am. “He decided to investigate  and upon arrival found a double-storey dwelling, informal structures and a motor vehicle alight,” said the city’s fire and rescue spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse. “He immediately called upon more resources to assist. The fire was contained at 7.50am. No injuries were reported.”
