The bright lights, stardom and recognition have come Belinda Davids’s way for her daily tribute to Whitney Houston. The Port Elizabeth-born singer with the powerful voice pays homage to her idol every day in the hit musical The Greatest Love of All: A Tribute to Whitney Houston. The show began in 2012 and has travelled to New Zealand, Australia, the US, UK, Israel, Russia, Norway, Germany and Ireland. The 42-year-old singer recently won an international special recognition award at the UK’s National Tribute Music Awards for her “global contribution to tribute performing”. “It’s just not something that comes along for tribute artists,” she said. Davids also won the BBC’s Even Better Than The Real Thing reality TV competition in 2017. She said she had been wary of the show’s title because it had never been her intention to be “better” than Houston. "There was only one Whitney Houston and there will only ever be one,” she said. A dream come true for the tribute artist was performing at the Apollo Theatre in New York City, where Houston made The Greatest Love of All music video. “Never in my wildest dreams” did she ever think she would perform on the same stage as Houston had. Davids’s show returns to SA at the Artscape in Cape Town from November 20 to December 1. It will be at The Mandela, at the Joburg Theatre, from June next year. Davids said she was excited about performing on home soil again.
