The new demerit system for South African road users is now law. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the  Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) bill on August 13. Here is what you need to know: How it will work The Aarto law was passed by the National Assembly in March. It is a demerit system for drivers who lose points for traffic offences, which may result in the loss of a driving licence. It is not clear when the law will come into effect, but some of the biggest changes include: 'The system will help reduce road carnage' Minister of transport Fikile Mbalula said he was optimistic the demerit system would help to reduce road carnage. Addressing the media, he said the government was determined to win the battle against disobedient motorists and persistent road fatalities. “They must know when they see a police officer that  the laws must be respected. Not even an attempt must be made to think that you can bribe an officer,” said Mbalula. Assessing law enforcement in Johannesburg and Tshwane, where Aarto is being implemented, he said the system was not just about punishment but intended “to ensure compliance and change of road users’ behaviour. “We look forward to working with officials at all spheres of government as we put in place the necessary regulations for the rollout. “We’ve won an important battle, but the war against road fatalities is not yet over, as we look at many victories ahead of ensuring safer roads.”
