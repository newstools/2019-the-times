Canadian singer Deborah Cox was left shaken by an incident on a South African Airways (SAA) plane at the weekend. According to the singer, a fire started in the cockpit, causing an emergency landing. South Africans took to Twitter to shed some humour on the situation, after a video of the crew chanting surfaced. The plane landed safely in Accra, Ghana. SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said flight SA209, travelling from Johannesburg to Washington DC, US, via Accra, experienced a technical problem and had to make a stop during the night. SowetanLIVE reported that he denied there was a fire in the cockpit.
