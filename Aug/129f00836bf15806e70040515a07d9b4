Poet and TV host, Ntsiki Mazwai is catching heat from all sides after she called Leanne Manas form SABC's Morning Live a talentless host whose success can only be attributed to her whiteness. Ntsiki said this as Leanne celebrated her 15th anniversary as the show's host. "I don't think Leanne Manas is amazing at her job. I think she's just white. And enjoying privilege. She can't even speak indigenous languages. She is not African." Tweeps were quick to come to Leanne's defence, calling Ntsiki bitter, angry and hateful, especially towards women. Unfazed by the criticism, she recorded and posted a minute-long video in which she said she stands by her views. "We have a situation in SA where white people get privilege and they get priority when it comes to jobs. What we witnessed in the SABC in the last couple of years, is black people getting shifted around, but white faces getting more prominent positions," she said. "My problem with this is SA is a black-dominated country, so white people can't be the face. That's ridiculous", she continued. Moja Love has since released a statement saying the channel does not share the same views as those expressed by Ntsiki.
