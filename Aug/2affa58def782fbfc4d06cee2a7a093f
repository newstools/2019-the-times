Tourists were treated to a spectacular sight when they encountered a lion along a road on a safari drive at the Kruger National Park. The lion walked alongside their car for a while, but was distracted by a lone kudu on the side of the road. He saw an opportunity for a meal and went after the kudu, taking it down while tourists watched in awe.
