As the country continues to debate immigration and xenophobia, Ntsiki Mazwai has taken a stance that Africans should be able to move freely on the continent. In a tweet that got people talking, Ntsiki said: "All Africans have the right to move freely in the whole of Africa ... Africa belongs to Africans. Miss me on that kwerekwere [foreigner] bulls**t." Her comments sparked fierce debate, with many agreeing with her opinion. "How can an African be a foreigner in Africa? Meanwhile, those that stole the land and other natural resources are watching us fight for what we don't even own - fighting for bread crumbs!" commented one follower. Other tweeps felt that the law should be respected, whether you are a foreigner or not. No stranger to stirring things up on social media, just a week ago Ntsiki slammed Morning Live hostÂ Leanne Manas. "I don't think Leanne Manas is amazing at her job; I think she's just white - and enjoying the privilege. She can't even speak indigenous languages. She is not African," said Ntsiki.
