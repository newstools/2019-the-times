Transport minister Fikile Mbalula wants to nearly double the number of Metrorail trains on the country's tracks by the end of December this year. In launching the Passenger Rail Association of SA (Prasa) "war room" on Thursday, Mbalula set a number of ambitious targets. This, Mbalula said in a statement, included: Mbalula said that the "continued decline of the quality of service Prasa provides" needed urgent intervention. To this end, the war room was being put in place to "aggressively improve the quality of our passenger rail service". He said that the war room would allow officials to make rapid decisions based on information gathered on the ground. "The war room will be supported by a Technical Task Team primarily made up of experts with in-depth knowledge and experience in a number of areas, which include train operations, signaling, rolling stock and security. "On a daily basis, the team will start the day with an assessment of the previous dayâ€™s performance and identify issues that hamper performance and make decisions on how to resolve these," said Mbalula.
