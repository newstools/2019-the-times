Brazilian authorities say Clauvino da Silva, also known as "Shorty", tried to leave prison dressed in his daughter's clothes and wearing a mask. Daily Mail reported that "his nerves and awkwardness walking as a woman gave him away". According to The Guardian Rio de Janeiro’s State Secretary of Prison Administration released a video in which Da Silva can be seen removing the mask and some of the clothes, and saying his full name. He has been transferred to a maximum-security prison and will be disciplined, officials said.
