Former Durban mayor Zandile Gumede has vowed to "set the record straight" after being removed from the powerful post this week. Gumede, who learned of her fate a day earlier following a decision by the ANC KZN provincial executive committee, said on Wednesday evening that she would be making a statement on the matter soon. "I ... reserve my right to remain silent while taking personal advice, including political and legal counsel, regarding this decision. I will be making a public statement and announcing my next course of action," she said. "In the main, I want to clear my name - particularly on how I have been characterised and vilified, directly or indirectly. "I believe it is important that I set the record straight as [the] first woman mayor of this beautiful city and [the] first woman chairperson of the biggest region of [the] ANC in South Africa," said Gumede, who held the position of ANC eThekwini chair. "I wonâ€™t be silenced and I will not allow the truth to be made a first casualty of this matter," she added. Gumede signed off her statement with "Mayor Zandile Gumede - eThekwini Metropolitan City". She is currently facing charges of fraud, including over a R208m Durban Solid Waste tender. However, it was not this criminal case that saw her being removed from her post, but rather the poor running of city services - particularly refuse removal.
