A female station commander and her unit have succeeded in dismantling a gang operating in a Worcester community plagued by gangsterism. In collaboration with the anti-gang unit, theyÂ helped to take out the local Corner Boys who were fighting with the more established JCYs. Since the gang was removed from the area through intelligence-driven arrests and adoption into programmes run by the local pastor, gun battles have ceased.
