I wonder how many South Africans spend years, decades even, paying for funeral policies for themselves and family, but never make a claim because they forgot all about the policy or their loved ones didn’t know about it or how to claim? I’m guessing a lot. Millions, maybe. So it’s a good idea to check your bank statement - there’s a very good chance you will get at least one surprise.
