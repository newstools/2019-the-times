The Currie Cup final can only go to one of three places – Johannesburg‚ Bloemfontein or Kimberley – and the teams taking part in the semifinals are evenly matched. The Griquas and the Golden Lions square off in a rerun of last week’s pulsating game in Kimberley in Saturday’s later semifinal. In the early semi the Sharks hop over the Drakensberg to Bloemfontein where the Cheetahs‚ who stunned Western Province with an impressive comeback win‚ will be waiting for them. The Cheetahs find themselves in the best position of all teams because the entire Currie Cup has taken place before the Pro14 season starts. At times‚ their form has fluctuated‚ but they’ve been a difficult side to beat at home. The Sharks got past them in Durban‚ but they needed a last-gasp Kobus van Wyk try to get past the nuggety Cheetahs. Such is the seriousness of the fixture for the defending champions‚ they’ve called on all their available Springboks for this encounter. Curwin Bosch‚ Andre Esterhuizen‚ Thomas du Toit‚ Coenie Oosthuizen and Lwazi Mvovo will all be starting. JP Pietersen will be on the bench for the visitors‚ who’ve demonstrated in the past that they’re good at winning playoffs on the road. They won last year’s final against Western Province in Cape Town after suffering a big defeat to the same team during the season. The Cheetahs aren’t easy beats and they’ve picked their best side for the encounter. The Griquas’ state of mind will be in question after the departure of their coach Brent Janse van Rensburg. The Griquas have done well to reach their first semifinal since 1998 and will again ask questions of a Lions side who have played well in patches this season. However‚ Lions coach Ivan van Rooyen’s side have made their opportunities count this season and they’ll be a difficult side to beat‚ especially at home. The nature of this season’s Currie Cup has been very dicey‚ so it shouldn’t come as a surprise if the results are unexpected; that being a Griquas/Sharks final in the Northern Cape.
