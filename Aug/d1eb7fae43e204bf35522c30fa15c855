Tyler Ivanoff was looking for firewood in Alaska when he found a message in a bottle from 1969. The letter was written in Russian and Ivanoff appealed for a translation on his Facebook page. His post soon went viral and it was later established that the letter was written by a sailor on Russian ship Sulak. BBC reports that Russian media tracked down the person who wrote the letter, a Captain Anatoly Botsanenko. “It was still dry on the inside and still smelled like wine or whatever, old alcohol. The note was dry,” Ivanoff told BBC.
