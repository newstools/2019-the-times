If you want to post gift parcels to friends and family overseas and have them arrive before Christmas Day — and you don’t want to pay airmail rates — you had better make your way to a post office fast. “SA currently has very little delay with items leaving the country, but these parcels have to go through time-consuming clearance procedures in the country of destination,” the Post Office said this week. For sea and surface mail, post your parcels no later than the dates below: Air mail is the only other postal option you have for parcels being sent to all other countries in Africa and they must be posted no later than December 1. That’s also the air mail cut-off date for all Christmas post being sent to other countries. How to make sure your parcel arrives safely: The Post Office apparently has had to advise that no live animals may be posted either. “All air mail items are X-rayed and scanned to make sure the content is legal and safe,” the Post Office said. “Parcels containing items that are not allowed are rejected by the transporting airlines and returned to the Post Office.”
