An organisation in deep financial trouble has given the rights to their most marketable domestic asset to a body in even more desperate straits in money terms. That’s what Cricket South Africa’s (CSA) announcement on Wednesday that the SABC would broadcast the second edition of the Mzansi Super League (MSL) boils down to. The positive is that exponentially more South Africans will have access to coverage of the tournament than if it was shown on subscription service SuperSport. Cricket in England‚ where the game has dwindled in the public consciousness since it has been locked behind Sky Sports’ paywall‚ serves as a cautionary tale. But how much revenue CSA‚ who according to the SA Cricketers’ Association could lose R1-billion by the end of the 2022 rights cycle‚ will earn from the SABC‚ who have asked government for a R3.2-billion bailout to avoid the prospect of disappearing from South Africa’s media landscape‚ is questionable. A release on Wednesday was big on symbolic noise but silent on the relevant details. “A key aspect of our vision for South African cricket is to make the game accessible to all and the SABC platforms make this very possible‚” it quoted CSA chief executive Thabang Moroe as saying. “Going this route last season was a huge success and this was reflected by the official viewership figures throughout the tournament.” Strangely‚ the figures themselves were not mentioned. The release said the SABC’s acting chief of operations‚ Sylvia Tladi‚ “enthusiastically endorsed the deal”. And so she did in the comments attributed to her: “The SABC is proud of its partnership with CSA to exclusively broadcast the popular and ground-breaking MSL for a second year in a row. “As a public broadcaster we are looking forward to once again demonstrating the power of our brands‚ which are able to truly bring the nation together through a sport that touches on every fibre of our diversity‚ while building national access to the exciting game of cricket.” No amount of that kind of facile‚ gushing PR-speak can hide the fact that this year’s MSL — which is as yet without a sponsor — will‚ like last year’s‚ bleed money. Why‚ then‚ must the show go on?
