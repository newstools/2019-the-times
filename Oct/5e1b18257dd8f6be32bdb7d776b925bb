Zozibini is no stranger to being a trendsetter and won over the nation again when she posed in a doek for her Miss Universe profile. The “woke” beauty pageant winner shared a beautiful picture of herself on Instagram rocking a bold emerald-green outfit. “My bio has been uploaded on the Miss Universe website, and it really hit me that this is actually happening.” “I am going to be representing my country on a global stage. Thank you for being a part of my story and journey. I can't wait to take you guys with me a bit further. We are taking SA to the universe and I couldn't be more proud and excited,” she wrote. Zozibini is the only contestant to cover her hair for the official headshot and social media users were stanning over her bold decision to go against the grain.
