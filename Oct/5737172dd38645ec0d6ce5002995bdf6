The commission of inquiry into state capture will continue to hear The New Age related testimony from the former Divisional Executive at Corporate Affairs of Eskom SOC Ltd: Chose Choeu, as well as Mark Pamensky. Pieter Pretorius, Eskom's acting general manager of strategic marketing and branding, told the state capture inquiry on Tuesday that he refused to do business with the Gupta family's TNA media outlet because they were not accredited with the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), a body that certifies and audits the circulations of major publications. He said he was then told by his bosses to comply and "close the deal". This instruction was allegedly passed down by Gigaba.
