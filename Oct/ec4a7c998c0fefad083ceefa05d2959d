The troubled Democratic Alliance is reeling from the sudden departure of two of its key figures, Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip. The DA's leader and federal chairperson announced their resignations on Wednesday. In a heartfelt speech, Maimane thanked those who had supported him and urged South Africans not to lose sight of the bigger picture - a democratic and united country.
