The Pentagon has released graphic images from last weekend's commando raid in Syria. The video shows the operation in which Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed on October 26 2019. The grainy, black-and-white aerial videos from the raid, released on October 30 2019, show US special operations forces closing in on Al-Baghdadi's compound and US aircraft firing at  militants. After the raid, Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, who led the operation, said: “It looks pretty much like a parking lot, with large potholes.” US President Donald Trump said Al-Baghdadi died “whimpering” and “crying”. However, McKenzie could not confirm this. Some have said this is the end of an era for the “war on terror”.
