Soulful singer Vusi Nova missed the much-awaited 2019 Mangaung African Cultural Festival (Macufe) after yet another health scare. Vusi was set to perform in the line-up for the biggest festival of the year in Bloemfontein this past weekend, but he had to be hospitalised fora  bacterial infection. The singer then took to Twitter to post a video of himself in a hospital bed looking weak, and apologised to his fans that he couldn't make it out. “Umh [clears throat], I'm sorry you guys, I couldn't make it to my gig tonight at Macufe. As you can see I am in the hospital. I've got a bacterial infection that started yesterday. I've been taking medication. I was hoping I will be okay by today but I am still not fine. I apologise for not making it out to Macufe on Saturday night.” Vusi then made a promise to his fans that he would make it up to them, somehow. This is not the first time the singer has had a health scare this year. He was forced to take a break from his busy schedule after a panic attack landed him in hospital in January. "I ended up in hospital yesterday because I just couldn’t breathe. Apparently I had a panic attack! This has made me realise I need to have more me time and just calm down," Vusi said at the time.
