Somizi has started giving fans an inside look into the planning of his nuptials, posting teasers from his reality show, where cameras went behind the scenes in the lead-up to the wedding. First there was the meeting with designer Gert-Johan Coetzee, where Gert asked how much skin Somizi and Mohale were comfortable with showing. *Insert crickets. Then there was the food and the idea that vegans would need to be catered for. SomGaga, obvs, had the best response. Watch the clip below.
