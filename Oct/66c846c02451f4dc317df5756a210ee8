An elderly woman in Brazil offered to give her cash to an armed robber, who told her he didn't want it and kissed her forehead instead. The Daily Mail reports that a surveillance camera inside the pharmacy in the city of Amarante where the robbery took place, showed the suspect speaking with the woman while his accomplice robbed a store employee. “The armed robber tapped her shoulder in an effort to calm her and planted a kiss on her forehead.” The thieves, who escaped with $240 (about R3,500) and other items haven't been found.
