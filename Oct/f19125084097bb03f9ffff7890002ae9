Law lecturer and Helen Suzman Foundation researcher ArvithaÂ  Doodnath, who led a campaign against gender violence at the Vaal University of Technology, was shot dead in Johannesburg at the weekend. The foundation and her friends are reeling at the loss of a bright young woman who had worked on the National Health Insurance (NHI) and started a campaign after the killing of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana.
