Power utility Eskom said there was no load-shedding planned for Sunday, when the Springboks take on Japan in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final. However, because the electricity system was under pressure, rotational power cuts could still happen. Stage 1 load-shedding was in place until 11pm on Saturday, "No load-shedding is planned for [Sunday], however the system remains constrained and volatile, and load-shedding could be implemented at short notice should there be a significant shift in plant performance and increased unplanned technical breakdown issues," the parastatal said in a statement posted on its Twitter feed on Saturday night. In a statement on Sunday morning, Eskom confirmed that there was no planned load-shedding for the day - but said the electricity network was "vulnerable". On the prognosis for the rest of the week, Eskom said more would be known by Sunday evening. "Additional generating units are expected to return to service today [Sunday] and repairs are progressing well on the conveyor belt at Medupi power station. In addition, Eskom has had an opportunity to replenish diesel reserves for the open cycle gas turbines and to increase water levels at its pumped power schemes in preparation for the week ahead. These reserves enable us to avoid and/or minimise the extent of load-shedding," Eskom said in a tweeted statement. However, while it looked good for no load-shedding on Sunday, Eskom again warned that it "could be implemented at short notice". Meanwhile, Eskom also asked that, because of a heatwave hitting parts of SA, airconditioning units be set at 23 degrees. "Eskom would like to thank customers for their support in reducing demand by using electricity sparingly and industrial customers for their participation in load curtailment, when necessary. In addition, we extend our gratitude to Eskom employees for their hard work and dedication over this difficult period and for sacrificing valuable time with their families," the statement read.
