Everyone knows that working out can be a total chore sometimes. But in true Zodwa style, she found a way to work out and still have fun. Zodwa shared a video of herself working out on the treadmill, as like most of us she wants to be ready for Dezemba. The dancer, however cranked up the music and tackled the treadmill as if it was a dance floor. That way you feel like you're partying and getting a workout at the same time. Thanks Zodwa!
