Patricia de Lille says outgoing DA leader Mmusi Maimane got a taste of his own medicine. A video of Patricia de Lille singing Sue Thompson's Have A Good Time  has emerged and is making waves on social media. The video comes after outgoing DA leader Mmusi Maimane's resignation on Wednesday, where he said  the DA was not “the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building one South Africa for all”. In the video, De Lille can be seen standing next to the SA flag and giggling throughout, while allegedly singing “goodbye” to Maimane. PODCAST | The DA's darkest days: What happened & what now?

I am not claiming to be a sangoma but I warned Mmusi Maimane that if he didn’t stand on principle his party’s laptop boys would swallow him up and spit him out.” De Lille resigned as a  member of the DA and as mayor of Cape Town in 2018 after a long battle with the party's leadership. TimesLIVE reported that when she resigned she said there would be more to follow suit. “There are two more councillors who have resigned from the DA effective. More councillors are going to resign.” Late last year De Lille formed  her own political party, GOOD, which earned two seats in parliament after  the general elections. Earlier this year, she was appointed  the minister of public works and infrastructure by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
