Not only will it be Kolisi’s 50th match in the green and gold of the Springboks‚ the Bok skipper will also have his father‚ Fezakele‚ and his father-in-law cheering for him from the stands at the Yokohama Stadium. It will be Fezakele Kolisi's first trip abroad having never travelled outside of the country before. “My dads are on their way to Japan. Utata’s first overseas trip‚ what a time to be alive‚” Rachel wrote on her Instagram account.
