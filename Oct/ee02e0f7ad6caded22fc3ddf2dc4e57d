There was "no financial wrongdoing" on the part of DA leader Mmusi Maimane over the rental of his house or the donation of a car by controversial company Steinhoff. This was the finding of the party's finance committee, which released the outcome in a statement on Friday afternoon. Committee chair Dion George said Maimane "submitted himself" for an investigation into the matters. George said he met Maimane on Monday September 30 and Friday October 4, when Maimane "produced facts with accompanying documentation". Maimane has recently been under fire after revelations that he was using a Toyota Fortuner donated by Steinhoff, and that he declared aÂ R4m house in Cape Town in a parliamentary register, despite the home never belonging to him. Outlining his two findings, George said on Friday: I have followed the financial trail as follows: "Maimane nor his trust own shares in the business and the house. Maimane indicated that the arrangement was a lease agreement and the financial trail confirms that." He said that these findings show there is "no financial illegality" on Maimane's part over the house and the car.
