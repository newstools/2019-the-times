He was robbed at gunpoint of his cellphone, liquor and an undisclosed amount of cash on Wednesday evening. The suspects shot the businessman several times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead. According to police, community members chased after the suspects, apprehended one and killed him by setting him alight.
