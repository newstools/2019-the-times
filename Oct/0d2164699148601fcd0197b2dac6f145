These delicious nuggets of shortbread-style biscuit with bits of almonds are dipped in icing sugar as they come out of the oven. Traditionally served on Greek religious holidays, they are available year round at Fournos. Long before the French original became standard fare in local coffee shops and delis, eating the Fournos version with a coffee felt so Parisian, with its gorgeous swirls of melted chocolate through crisp layers of pastry. Golden-brown, crisp skin with a generous sprinkling of rosemary and salt, and succulent flavoursome flesh make Fournos's spit-roasted chickens a big hit - and a quick pick-up meal solution. These are not the big birds of the past that would feed a crowd - in fact they feel a bit spring chicken - but the flavour hasn't changed. The combination of spinach and feta cheese in a crumbly paper-thin pastry may be commonplace now but 20 years ago the Greek original was considered exotic. The pies, the size of a hand, are as good as they ever were, crammed with a generous filling, the feta offering just the right amount of saltiness in a wodge of green spinach, all of it wrapped in phyllo pastry with a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds. Long before we could pronounce "cia a batta" correctly, Fournos was baking this gorgeous crisp loaf with the holey, chewy centre studded with slivers of Greek calamata olives, which offer a lovely saltiness. Add a chunk of cheese, some cold meat or a dollop of hummus or tzatziki, and lunch is made. This one is no skinny little number with a mouthful of filling, but deep and generous with good pastry. The Fournos quiche comes in a variety of flavours. One quiche will easily serve 8 to 10 people, so it's good value too.
