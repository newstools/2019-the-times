On Friday, the tax agency said in a statement that after consultations, Sars and Mokoena had "agreed to end the employment relationship with immediate effect". "Sars will not proceed with further actions against Mr Teboho Mokoena in pursuance of allegations against him. "Sars wishes him well in his future endeavours."
