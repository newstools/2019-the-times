The matric Information Technology (IT) exams went smoothly with only minor disruptions caused by load-shedding, the Gauteng department of education said on Friday. “The IT examination went very well yesterday. We only had a few glitches,” department spokesperson Steve Mabona said. Mabona said out of 1,224 candidates, only nine could not write the exam. The affected pupils are expected to do a rewrite. Mabona said  there were some delays due to  load-shedding, but these didn’t disrupt the exams. On Thursday, the Computer Application Technology practical exam was “severely affected” by Eskom's power cuts. A total of 317 matric pupils in Gauteng will have to rewrite their practical examination at a later date. The department also had to contend with a report of a bomb scare at a school in Vereeniging on Wednesday. The department said the matrics had finished writing and exams were not affected. Eskom’s acting CEO Jabu Mabuza announced that Stage 1 load-shedding would be implemented on Friday. Mabuza said that, as of Thursday evening, the system remained constrained and vulnerable, but they hoped for a weekend free of load-shedding.
