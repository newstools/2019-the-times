Seven supercars were among 11 vehicles  seized in a multimillion-rand raid by members of the Hawks and the Asset Forfeiture Unit in Durban on Thursday. The vehicles were confiscated at the lavish homes of some of the 16 people implicated in a R208m Durban Solid Waste (DSW) contract, awarded in 2016. While Zandile Gumede is one  of the accused in the matter, none of the vehicles were seized at either of her two homes on the day. A list of the vehicles seized and who they belong to include: Two Land Rovers (a Discovery 4 and a Defender) as well as an Isuzu double cable and a Ford Ranger Wildtrak were also seized.
