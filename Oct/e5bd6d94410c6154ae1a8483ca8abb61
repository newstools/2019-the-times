A man who allegedly robbed a store at the Cresta mall in Johannesburg on Monday afternoon was killed during a shootout with police. SAPS Gauteng spokesperson Brig Mathapelo Peters confirmed that an electronics store at the mall was hit. She said a group of men entered the store and stole several electronic appliances. The robbers then opened fire as they fled the mall, wounding a security guard. He was taken to hospital. Following the robbery, one of getaway vehicles, a Nissan NP200 bakkie, was spotted. Officers from the anti-gang unit confronted the robbers on a nearby highway and a shootout ensued. One suspect was shot dead, Peters said. One was arrested and a third fled the scene. Police recovered one firearm, which would be sent for ballistic testing. Peters said police were still searching for a second vehicle, a white VW Polo hatchback, which went in the direction of Pimville. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived at the scene around 4pm. He said a man believed to be in his 30s sustained a gunshot wound to his upper leg. He later confirmed that the injured man was a security guard. The man was treated on the scene and transported to a nearby hospital. Meiring said three staff members of a shop in the mall were also treated after they were allegedly assaulted by the gunmen. In a statement on Tuesday night, Cresta Shopping Centre confirmed that the Dion Wired store was hit. "Centre management can confirm that a security guard was injured in an attempt to stop the robbery, and he is safe and being attended to in hospital," the statement read.
