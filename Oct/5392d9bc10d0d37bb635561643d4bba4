A car ploughed through a shack in an informal settlement south of Johannesburg on Sunday morning, killing a sleeping man, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics had responded to reports of a collision on Impala Road, Soweto, in the direction of Protea Glen just after 6am. “Reports from the scene indicate that the driver of a light motor vehicle lost control resulting in the vehicle leaving the road, crashing through an informal settlement.” Herbst said the vehicle had crashed through a shack in which a man was asleep. “Medics assessed the scene and found that the man who had been sleeping had sadly sustained fatal injuries and was declared deceased on the scene,” he said.
