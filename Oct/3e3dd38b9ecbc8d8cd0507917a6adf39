A man in India was shocked to find a 4.5m cobra in his toilet shed. The man was taking a bath outside the shed on October 7 2019 when he spotted the cobra and informed his family. Rescuers were called and, with the help of two youths, the snake was removed and released, uninjured, back into the wild.
