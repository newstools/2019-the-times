Facials and gym sessions in Los Angeles, US. Mogul and businesswoman Connie Ferguson is living her best life, despite the drama between Ferguson Films and seasoned actor Vatiswa Ndara. On Tuesday, Connie shared a video in a consultation room with a skin specialist, a treat she said would help rejuvenate her skin. “I didn't think I'd come to LA without popping in to see Dr Ourian for some cool laser which treats skin pigmentation, blemishes, refines pores and fine lines.” In another post, she shared a snap of herself with her gym squad. The Fergusons have been thrust into the spotlight after Vatiswa blasted the power couple in an open letter to sport, arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa. In the six-page letter, Vatiswa accused the Fergusons of exploitation and lamented the state of the entertainment industry, which she said subjected actors and crew to unpleasant working conditions. She also made reference to an offer she allegedly received from the Fergusons for her lead role on iGazi, the third season of which will air soon. Vatiswa said she was offered R110,000 for five weeks of shooting,  a fraction of what she had hoped for. “Initially I was going for a cool million, minister, then dropped it to R700,000.” She said both proposals were rejected. On Wednesday, the Fergusons issued a statement in which they labelled the allegations "misguided" and previously told TshisaLIVE that they intended to take legal action against Vatiswa.
