An SA pastor, who allegedly used more than R1m from the credit cards and petty cash of a former London church to go on luxury European family holidays, has been barred for 10 years from holding any managerial position at any UK-based charities. Last Monday, the axe came down on Martin Phelps, who, along with his wife Sandy, established the Rhema Church London in 1991.
